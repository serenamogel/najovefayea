They were notoriously hard to kill, and their weapons could smash through a Borg cube with the same ease that a photon torpedo could tear through Neelix’s Talaxian freighter.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>As individuals, they were immensely strong, needed no atmosphere for breathing, and could rip human limbs off with limited effort. Their DNA was of a triple helix structure, and each cell contained one hundred times the DNA of a human cell. The species also appeared to have as many as five distinct sexes. Their powerful immune systems rendered them impervious to Borg assimilation. On top of all this, they were telepathic, able to speak to each other using only their minds.</p><h2 id=h-relations-with-the-federation data-injectable=false>Relations with the Federation</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/8472.png><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>Unlike the Borg, they were also capable of hatred, and quickly came to see Voyager and humanity as their greatest threat, thanks to Janeway and her crew developing bio-molecular warheads (using Borg nanoprobes) capable of defeating Species 8472’s ships. When Voyager was trapped in Fluidic Space, they were forced to destroy several pursuing vessels during their escape, drawing the ire and fear of Species 8472.</p><p data-characters=729 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>Species 8472 could genetically modify their bodies to mimic other lifeforms – even humans. Some time after their initial encounter with the species, Voyager discovered <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Terrasphere 8</a>, a perfect recreation of Starfleet Academy, complete with mimicked Starfleet officers, right down to the Academy groundskeeper. This base was being used as a training camp by members of Species 8472 in preparation to infiltrate and annihilate the Federation. While other Captains may have destroyed the facility, Janeway instead managed to establish communications with Species 8472, and brokered a ceasefire with them in exchange for the technology used to design the bio-molecular warheads. Voyager and 8472 therefore parted on amicable terms.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>Despite returning to Fluidic Space with a newfound respect for the Federation, Species 8472 remains a worrying presence in the wider Star Trek universe. With so many new Trek series in production, it is quite possible that the one enemy the Borg feared could make a deadly reappearance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mmKudXai9pq%2FInqpmcGRsf261zWaqrZmiYsGzscpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
