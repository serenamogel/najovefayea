While Shigeo is contemplating which path to choose in high school, most of his friends seem to have made up their minds about their future, including his longtime intense crush Takane. In case you’ve forgotten who Tsubomi Takane is (after all, it’s been three years since the last season came out) fear not! Here’s everything there is to know about Mob’s crush.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-is-tsubomi-takane data-injectable=false>Who is Tsubomi Takane?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tsubomi-takane.jpg><p data-characters=655 data-current-count=955 data-injectable=true>Tsubomi Takane is a middle school student who attends Salt Middle School alongside Shigeo ‘Mob’ Kageyama. On par with Mob, Takane is currently 14 years old and they have been friends since childhood, playing together at a park since they were young. Takane is also the one character Mob showed off his powers to in an attempt to impress her. But they grew apart after Takane grew uninterested in Mob’s psychic powers, leading to them no longer playing together. Since then, Mob noticed that Takane is more interested in feats of physical strength. Thus he decided to rarely show his psychic powers and joined the Body Improvement Club instead.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Though most of the information about Takane’s personality comes from Mob himself, short moments in the anime also give us a glimpse, showing her as a calm and kind-hearted teenage girl. She is very protective of her friends, as evidenced by the incident where she went to Reigen’s office to ask for relationship advice, with the intent of checking if his advice was to be trusted or not.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=742 data-injectable=true>Her kind-heartedness is also evident from the way she encourages and cares for Mob, in spite of not showing her feelings very often. Takane is also hinted at as being particularly intelligent, considering her high school of choice is Yuzu Pepper High School, which is known for accepting students that constitute the top ranking of each school.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Although Takane doesn’t get much screen time, she has been Mob’s longtime crush, thus instantly becoming one of the most important and influential characters in Mob Psycho 100, as her actions have a large impact on Mob, even without her knowing.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Will she be important in Mob Psycho 100 season three?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tsubomi-takane-mob-psycho.jpg><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Although season three has just started, if the events in the manga are anything to go by, Takane will continue to have an important role in the story, even if she is not directly involved. As Mob grows more intensely attached to Takane, he’ll continue having her in mind when he is making decisions that will highly change the way he navigates life.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=false>Although the manga, written and illustrated by One, has already seen its ending in 2017, the animated series is around two arcs from its end, giving Mob plenty of time to gather up the courage to finally confess his feelings to Takane.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6tb%2FUm6amoV2prqytzZ5koqZdoryjec%2BssJygn2J%2BcXyMoZyrnV2ewG6ty6VksqelYrumscNmq6hlm6O8uHnAm6aurF2otaqzxKiqZpuiqsCpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
