Recommended Videos Carter, who has over six million followers on TikTok, is most known for his commentary on scandals that happen in and out of the social media platform. He famously starts most of his videos with the line “people are mad at [insert celebrity, TikToker, influencer, etc…]” and captions those videos with “what do yall think?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He posted three back-to-back videos of the situation, scoring a combined eight million views in total. In Rae’s scandalous photo, she can be seen wearing an all-white bikini with the words “father” and “son” printed on the right and left top pieces. The zinger was that the bikini also had the word “holy spirit” printed on the bottom piece.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@noahglenncarter href=#>@noahglenncarter</a><p>What do yall think <a title=addisonrae href=#>#addisonrae</a> <a title=foryo href=#>#foryo</a> <a title=christian href=#>#christian</a></p><a title="♬ Paris - 斌杨Remix" href=#>♬ Paris – 斌杨Remix</a></figure><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>Neither TikTok nor the public at large took kindly to Rae’s apparent disrespect to the Christian faith, and the 21-year-old TikTok star immediately took the post down from Instagram.
