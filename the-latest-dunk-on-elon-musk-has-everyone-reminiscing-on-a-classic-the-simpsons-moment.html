Following its debut at Springfield’s film festival, he and his film get emphatically booed by the audience. Hearing the boos, Burns asks assistant and devotee Smithers if he was getting booed. Smithers, famously willing to do anything to keep Burns happy, tells a little white lie: “No, they’re saying Boo-urns!”</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Life imitated art when Chappelle’s introduction for Musk saw him get eviscerated ad inundated with boos.
