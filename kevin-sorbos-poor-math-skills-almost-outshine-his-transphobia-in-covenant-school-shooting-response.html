It left multiple elementary school students, staff members, and teachers dead, and marked yet another occasion in which our most powerful politicians ignore pleas to protect the children of this nation. It was a tragedy that could have been avoided if we‚Äôd learned from any number of horrific lessons taught over the years, as gun violence continues to be one of America‚Äôs most consistent and damaging national habits.</p><p>In response to reports that the latest in a long line of mass shooters is a trans woman, actor and perpetual migraine-triggerer <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Sorbo</a></strong> revealed that his math skills are almost on-par with his acting abilities. The deeply unremarkable actor (Karl Urban was more memorable in Xena: Warrior Princess) shared a meme, of all things, in response to the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Covenant school shooting</a></strong>, making a point that was immediately slapped down by people with actual brains in their skulls.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5nASYX73mW</a></p>‚Äî Kevin Sorbo (@ksorbs) <a href=#>March 28, 2023</a></figure><p>Sorbo attempted to own the libs with a meme noting that, of literally hundreds of mass shooters in the history of this blood-soaked nation, four identified as non-binary or trans. We‚Äôre no mathematicians here (we went into journalism for a reason) but we still know enough to realize Sorbo is not making the point he thinks he is. In fact, he‚Äôs really just driving home the fact that a full 98% of mass shooters are male (and 99.89% are cis/straight), a detail people were quick to point out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Math is interesting.</p><p>Trans people make up 1.9% of the US population, but only 0.1% of attackers in shootings since 2018 identified as trans.</p><p>Meanwhile, cis/straight people makes up 89.5% of the same population, but also make up 99.89% of the attackers in shootings since 2018. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/jEEfxixyj5</a></p>‚Äî Unusual Salty Dog üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è (@Grey_IsTrue) <a href=#>March 28, 2023</a></figure><p>Countless people noted that, across literally every mass shooting in the history of the world, there is one (and only one) common denominator: guns. Without guns, there could be no mass shootings, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the decision-makers in America</a> just can‚Äôt seem to wrap their brains around the concept. Neither can Sorbo, it seems, but we‚Äôre less concerned with his impact on the safety of America‚Äôs youth.</p><p>Some people additionally pointed to the list of apparently ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù serial killers and worked to use Sorbo‚Äôs logic against him. Four mass shooters, in the history of the nation, have come from the LGBTQ+ community, but far more have come from the house of God. Did those people just need more religion in their lives?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, John Wayne Gacy, Earle Nelson, Henry Lee Lucas, Gary Ridgway, Dean Corll and Wayne Williams.

(@JAMALIGLE) <a href=#>March 28, 2023</a></figure><p>Responses to Sorbo‚Äôs tweet are almost universally negative, as people blast the actor for ignoring a legacy of gun violence in an attempt to shape the narrative. As it turns out, it would take years, and hundreds of trans, non-binary, and gay mass shooters, to come close to equalling the history of bloodshed established by (largely white) cis men.</p><p>Pointing fingers isn‚Äôt getting us anywhere, however. Our nation and, it seems, in particular, our children, will continue to bleed for so-called ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù until real, meaningful gun control is passed in this country. Until that happens ‚Äî something that only seems possible once the likes of Mitch McConnell and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> are far from influence ‚Äî gun violence will continue as the leading cause of death of American children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S4psLIp2Ssp6KXvLR5z6imq2WdlsGpedKkoKWko2KurbnOrKtmp6WpwKm1zZ5koaGjYsGzrc2sp6Gnkp6ubrXNZpqorpWjrq%2FAjKyaoaefoXq0tM6oq6Kml2K%2Fpr%2FPqKWsnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
