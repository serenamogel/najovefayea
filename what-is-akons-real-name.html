With a stage name as simple and well-known as Akon, it should come as no surprise his true name is quite lengthy.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-akon-s-real-name data-injectable=false>What is Akon’s real name?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Although Akon rose to fame at the start of the 2000s, it wasn’t until 2009 that the RNB singer shared his full name publicly. This came during an appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> where he explained to Ellen the origins of his name.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=199 data-injectable=false>Akon’s full name is Aliaune Damala Bouga Time Puru Nacka Lu Lu Lu Badara Akon Thiam. With 52 letters and 12 words, it’s no wonder the musician chose to roll with the much shorter stage name Akon.</p><p data-characters=200 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>The name comes from Akon’s Senegalese heritage. While he was born and raised in Missouri, he spent much of his childhood in the West African country of Senegal, even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">referring to it as his hometown</a>.</p><a class=wp-block-dotesports-affiliate-button__link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noopener noreferrer">Sign up to Apple TV+. 7-Day Free Trial.</a><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=854 data-injectable=true>While his stage name may be short, it is not common for traditional African names to be long. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a> explains that traditional African names often have unique and rich stories behind them. These stories often involve things like birth, emotions, faith, and ancestors. This means that someone’s name can give you a wealth of information about who they are. In many African cultures, longer names can actually be seen as more prestigious or meaningful.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>Even though Akon’s full name might have a lot of significance to him and his family, he shared that it was the easier choice to use something shorter.</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>He explained: “Akon is a lot easier and it’s the middle name. No one ever uses their middle name you notice that? No one uses their middle name why do we have it? So I decided to use it.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=67 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=false>So, there you have it.
