My problem is I don't like Parisians.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>13</td><td>The concept of sex symbol in France is different. They don't like the 'sex symbol' in France. I don't consider myself a sex symbol because all my cousins would laugh at me. "Ah, look at the sex symbol! He's coming today!" So, no, I can't be a sex symbol.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>14</td><td>I was raised in a very traditional and old school way, so I'm not very comfortable with these kinds of love scenes on the screen.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>15</td><td>I came rather close to dying. A serious motorcycle accident. It made me less flippant about danger! It was such a pleasure to walk again after a long period of immobilization. It's an extraordinary joy.

You must have a point of view on everything even if you have to change it often. That's my terrorist aspect in action! I need to have prejudices to make my choices, I mustn't let myself be invaded by ultra conservatism. Better be wrong in one's decision and then step backwards rather than not choosing at all.</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>18</td><td>I was not very comfortable. I always say I'm not very comfortable in love scenes because I'm shy, because I don't play naked. It's very rare for a French actor. I have an issue with that. But as I've said, when I punch somebody in a movie, I don't do it for real. [It's] the art of lying and we try to lie very well, in our love scenes also.</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>19</td><td>If I had to fall in love with all the actresses I play with and live the situations I have to play, I would be lost ! I need to be solid and know who I really am to have fun in making something else. I noticed, while talking with other actors, that they often let ambiguity float. I don't like ambiguity, it's dangerous. I need distance. I also think that the result would prevent the audience from identifying to the characters. If you feel the things too strongly, you simply close the doors.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=29.002245172878><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=1.0714285714286><td>1</td><td>Filming <a href=#>Taking Lives</a> (2004) with <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>.
