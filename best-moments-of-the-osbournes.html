In fact, The Osbournes was the first show of its kind to ever win a Primetime Emmy, besting the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/ben-affleck data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ben Affleck" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ben Affleck</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/matt-damon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Matt Damon" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Matt Damon</a>-produced HBO docuseries Project Greenlight, among others, for Outstanding Non-Fiction Program (Reality) in 2002.</p><img alt="'The Osbournes' Photo" title="'The Osbournes' Photo" width=1968 height=2460 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-osbournes-2002photo-by-michael-yarish_mtv_getty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Michael Yarish/MTV/Getty Images</span><p>The Osbournes, 2002</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With "millions of people living as foes," the Osbournes taught viewers to "learn how to love and forget how to hate," long before they tried to keep up with the Kardashians. And their trailblazing success came by way of them just being themselves.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"That's the way we are," Ozzy, whose cry of "Sharon!" became an instant catchphrase, said during a 2002 radio interview. "I was walking around Manhattan and people who wouldn't generally come up to me were going: 'It's them — it's Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne.' We broadened our audience by millions."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While the series had its serious storylines — such as documenting Sharon's cancer diagnosis, as well as Ozzy's scary ATV accident — by the time its final episode aired in 2005, viewers had gotten their share of outrageous moments. Here are 10 of the wildest scenes that kept fans glued to their TV screens.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sharon's ham-throwing incident</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During a Season 1 episode titled "Won't You Be My Neighbor?" the Osbournes are driven to the edge of sanity by their noisy folk-singing neighbors. First Jack tries to drown them out by blaring death metal. But after his efforts fail, leave it to foul-mouthed matriarch Sharon to take matters into her own hands, throwing bagels and a large ham over the fence into their neighbor's yard. The local cops show up to diffuse the situation and tell an at-her-wits'-end Sharon to not waste good food and call them next time instead.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Kelly's "vagina doctor" appointment</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the same episode, Kelly complains to her dad that her older sister Aimee — who refused to participate in the show — scheduled a gynecologist appointment for her. Ozzy's hilarious response? "All you have to do is say ‘F**k off’ when the vagina doctor calls." As he becomes suspicious about Kelly's sexual activity, he asks her, "You haven't been playing doctors and nurses have you?"</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ozzy's walk of shame</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After slipping in the bathroom and injuring his foot, Ozzy breaks two doctors' orders: stay off his feet and don't mix alcohol with his pain medication. In the Season 1 Thanksgiving episode, an ever-stubborn Ozzy insists on taking the family's bulldog Lola for a walk and ends up stumbling — and singing — down the street, leash in hand. Sharon tells Jack that his father is "stoned," and sends him to catch up to Ozzy and bring him home.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ozzy and Sharon's TMI sex talk</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While sitting in a friend's car during Season 1, Jack tunes in to one of his parents' radio interviews, only to hear them discussing their sex life. Among the topics a wincing Jack endures: Ozzy's excessive Viagra use and getting erect when Sharon is either asleep or uninterested.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The dog therapist</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I'm not picking up dog sh*t... I'm a rock star!" Ozzy exclaimed in a Season 2 episode where the family's many dogs are pooping all over the house. In a particularly outlandish moment, Ozzy talks into one of the dogs' butts, begging her to not poop anymore. A dog therapist, who Ozzy labels a "fruit loop," is brought in, despite his protests: "You don't need to hire a dog therapist, you just need to wake up at 7 am and open the f***ing door!"</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ozzy versus technology</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A new set of high-tech gadgets for the home has Ozzy incensed. After getting the TV stuck on The Weather Channel and becoming confused by a ringing telephone, he calls for Jack to come to his aid. "I'm a very simple man," he says. "You've got to have a computer now to turn the f**king TV on and off... I press one button and the shower starts. What is this? Where am I, man? The nightmare continues. Nightmare in Beverly Hills."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ozzy versus the ocean</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hilarity ensues when Ozzy attempts to build a fire outside his and Sharon's beach house too close to the ocean in Season 2's “The Ozzy Man and the Sea.” First he curses the ocean in an expletive-filled rant and tells it to "go to Alaska." The water also wins round two, when Ozzy tries to catch a fish for Sharon, who laughs hysterically after he ends up falling on his behind.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Sharon's bubble-brained idea</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ozzy goes off on his wife after she plans to use bubbles as a special effect during one of his concerts. His reaction: “Bubbles! Oh, come on, Sharon! I'm f***ing Ozzy Osbourne, the Prince of f***ing Darkness. Evil! Evil! What's f***ing evil about a butt-load of f***ing bubbles?”</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Ozzy and Jack's fishing trip</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Season 2's "Angler Management" episode showcased a father-son fishing trip for Jack and Ozzy. First the pair gets in trouble for throwing firecrackers and pelicans, but the highlight is Ozzy's catches of the day: tin cans and a bird.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Kelly and Jack come to blows</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After Jack dances with his sister's nemesis <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/christina-aguilera data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christina Aguilera" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Christina Aguilera</a> at a party in Season 2, Kelly becomes enraged. "When you hate someone, I hate someone," she tells Jack. "You just wanted to say that you danced with Christina Aguilera." As the argument gets more heated, Kelly begins punching and kicking Jack, and Sharon eventually has to break up the fight.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikqK6ZmsBuwNVomZ6rpGK6sLnEp6usZZ%2BberW0xGamrJqfqr%2BvsdI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
