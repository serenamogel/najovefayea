Recommended Videos This hint of humanity becomes more interesting as the story progresses and viewers are introduced to new Titans who have far more cunning intentions.

If you’ve read the manga or finished the anime you know just how true that statement is, and it really does get sinister.</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>So just how many Titans are there? We’ll walk you through them here, just be careful—there are spoilers ahead.</p><h2 id=h-how-many-titans-are-there-in-attack-on-titan data-injectable=false>How many Titans are there in Attack on Titan?</h2><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>There are nine major titan forms that were created by Ymir, the founder of the Titans, upon her death. Alongside these, there are a lot of smaller, less threatening titans in the show which can be split into two different types, Pure Titans and Abnormal Titans.</p><h3 id=h-pure-titans data-injectable=false>Pure Titans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Pure-Titans-attack-on-titan.jpg><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=517 data-injectable=true>The most basic of all the Titan forms, Pure Titans are the most commonly seen in the show. Their appearance is reminiscent of humans, however, they are substantially larger, ranging between two to 15 meters in height.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>Often these Titans also boast disproportionate body features adding to their menacing appearance. As the show progresses and we gain more insight into the origins of this Titan species, their likeness to humans becomes more clear.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Combat against pure Titans is much more simple than the other Titan forms. Pure Titans are mindless in nature and therefore easy to deceive. To eliminate them, like most Titans, one solid blow to the nape will do the trick.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=h-abnormal-titans data-injectable=false>Abnormal Titans</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/attack-on-titan-smiling-titan.jpg><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=599 data-injectable=true>Abnormal Titans are simply an upgrade upon the Pure Titan. These “abnormals” display more intelligence, making them more difficult to deceive or evade. In the series, this type of Titan was aware enough to avoid conflict with humans instead opting to pursue objectives as part of a greater goal.</p><h3 id=h-colossal-titan data-injectable=false>Colossal Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/attack-on-titan-s1.jpg><p data-characters=233 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>The first of the nine Titan fragments of Ymir’s power we see in the series is the Colossal Titan in episode one. As the name suggests, this form is colossal in size and can use its massive form to expel heat and energy as a weapon.</p><p data-characters=118 data-current-count=118 data-injectable=false>Over the seasons, the host of the Colossal Titan has changed, however, its appearance and abilities remained the same.</p><h3 id=h-armored-titan data-injectable=false>Armored Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/attack-on-titan.jpg><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Also introduced in episode one, the Armored Titan gets its name from the bone-like armor covering large portions of its body. Combat with this Titan form is especially difficult, as breaking through this armor plating is no easy task.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>In addition to the armor, this Titan has shown impressive strength abilities and most notably the ability to harden its exterior in places to protect itself from damage.</p><h3 id=h-attack-titan data-injectable=false>Attack Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Attack-on-titan.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Main character Eren Yeager’s own Titan</a> is the Attack Titan. As the show goes on, Eren learns new abilities for his Titan form, including the ability to harden and control other Titans. Most importantly though, the Attack Titan boasts the power to inherit future memories.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>This ability allows Eren to know and influence events at all stages of the timeline. During the show, he uses this to set in motion events of the past, as well as to chart the best way to influence the future. This ability is unique to the Attack Titan and it works by connecting all users of the form together.</p><h3 id=h-female-titan data-injectable=false>Female Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/attack-on-titan-annie-female-titan.jpg><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=263 data-injectable=false>While the title the Female Titan doesn’t give much away in regard to abilities, this Titan form boasts plenty of useful tools that make it a powerful weapon for combat. Firstly, like the Attack Titan, the Female Titan can harden and control other Titans itself.</p><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=597 data-injectable=true>The difference is that the Female Titan is only able to attract the other Titans to herself instead of controlling them to go after an enemy. One of the Female Titan’s most important traits is its versatility. In combat, this Titan form has great endurance and mobility, making it extremely difficult to best in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=78 data-injectable=false><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Opening in ‘Attack on Titan’ Ranked</a> on The Mary Sue</p><h3 id=h-beast-titan data-injectable=false>Beast Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Attack-on-Titan-Beast-Titan-.jpg><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One of the more unique Titan forms, the Beast Titan</a> is covered in a fur cloak and looks like a massive Bigfoot-inspired creature. Despite its beast-like appearance, don’t be fooled, the host behind this Titan form is one of the more intelligent characters on the show and it is apparent as the Beast Titan is commonly seen in the backline commanding troops for an attack.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>The Titan does this by using its two key abilities. The first and most useful of these is the ability to control pure Titans and send them into battle, but the Beast Titan has an arm like a cannon that can hurl objects at an incredible speed, inflicting massive damage to its target.</p><h3 id=h-jaw-titan data-injectable=false>Jaw Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/attack-on-titan-falco-jaw-titan.jpg><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>One of the smaller Titan forms, the Jaw Titan has incredible speed and agility alongside unbelievable crushing strength with its jaw. This Titan form is one of the last introduced in the series and changed hands between hosts in the show’s final act.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>When wielded by its second user, after some modification at the hands of the Beast Titan, the Jaw Titan gains the ability to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sprout wings and take flight</a>.</p><h3 id=h-cart-titan data-injectable=false>Cart Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cart-Titan-Attack-on-Titan.jpg><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Even when rolling for war with Titans, you still need some utility, and the Cart Titan accomplishes just that. Another of the smaller Titan forms, the Cart Titan has incredible speed and endurance allowing it to cover distance fast while carrying allies or weaponry.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>The Titan form is also quadrupedal, meaning that it walks on all fours allowing for this incredible speed.</p><h3 id=h-warhammer-titan data-injectable=false>Warhammer Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Warhammer-Titan-Attack-on-Titan.jpg><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=213 data-injectable=false>Another of the Titan forms that isn’t introduced until late into the series, the Warhammer Titan is incredibly powerful with its unique ability to forge structures and create objects using its hardening ability.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>As we find out in the show, another factor that makes this form so powerful is that it can be operated remotely without the user being forced to enter the front lines at any time.</p><h3 id=h-founding-titan data-injectable=false>Founding Titan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Founding-Titan.png><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Above all other Titans, the Founding Titan is the most powerful. The abilities begin with the power to create Titans and it is implied that the user could even influence the size and appearance of these newly created subjects.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=false>To complement that ability, the Founding Titan can control pure Titans, but the list doesn’t stop there. The Founding Titan is capable of manipulating memories, communicating telepathically, and seeing into the future. Yes, it gets that far out of hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiuMtmq6KskaN6tcXPnqpmoZ5irrXAwJyiZqeeYsGqwMCnZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
