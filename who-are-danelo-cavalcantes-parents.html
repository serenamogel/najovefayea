In April 2021, he committed a heinous act that would forever alter the lives of those involved. In a gruesome act, he fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend, Deborah Brandao, in front of her two young children, aged four and seven at the time. The shocking crime saw Brandao endure a horrifying 38 stab wounds during the brutal attack.</p><p>Cavalcante’s arrest was swift, but it was revealed that he had an outstanding murder warrant in Brazil for a previous crime, underscoring his violent history. In 2017, he was suspected of murdering a man who owed him money in his home country.</p><p>Following the murder of Brandao, Cavalcante was apprehended in Virginia, leading to his trial in Pennsylvania, which resulted in a life sentence, ensuring that he would no longer pose a threat to innocent lives. However, fate had other plans.</p><p>In a stunning turn of events, just one week after being sentenced to life in prison, Danelo Cavalcante managed to escape from Chester County Prison in West Chester, Pennsylvania. The circumstances of his escape remain shrouded in mystery, with prison officials providing limited information and only confirming that an investigation is underway.</p><p>Cavalcante’s escape has prompted an extensive manhunt in the region, involving numerous law enforcement agencies. Residents within a six-mile radius of the prison have been put on alert and advised to exercise extreme caution. Officials have deployed various resources, including dogs, drones, and helicopters, in their relentless efforts to locate him.</p><p>His dangerous status extends beyond the borders of the United States, as Cavalcante is also wanted for murder in Brazil, further heightening the urgency of his capture. Authorities are issuing a stern warning to the public not to approach him under any circumstances and to immediately contact 911 if they possess any information regarding his whereabouts.</p><p>The prison break has sent shockwaves through the community, prompting West Chester University, situated near the prison, to temporarily suspend classes as a precautionary measure.</p><p>Both the US Marshals Service and local authorities have jointly offered a $10,000 (£7,889) reward for information leading to the capture of Danelo Cavalcante, a man who has transformed from a convicted murderer into a fugitive on the run. His life story serves as a chilling reminder of the darkest recesses of human nature and the imperative need for justice in the face of such abhorrent crimes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Danelo Cavalcante’s Parents?</h2><p>Details about his parents are not known.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jrCfqGWRp7JusMCnnKWnXZiut63LnJinrJWoerGt0Z6lratf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
