The King of Staten Island (2020), which Davidson starred in and co-wrote, was a semi-autobiographical film, and Davidson’s work on Saturday Night Live repeatedly referenced his actual life, from his Weekend Update sketches to his “Stuck in the House” music video.
Now he’s at it again with Bupkis, the Peacock original series now streaming. Described as a “heightened fictionalized version of Pete Davidson’s life,” Davidson co-wrote and stars in the show, playing a version of himself (also named Pete Davidson) who lives with his mother in Staten Island while trying to navigate his comedy career and the challenges that come with fame."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I pay the mortgage.” Davidson lives with his mother, Amy Waters Davidson, in real life, too, and has repeatedly joked about it on Saturday Night Live, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TalRWsuSJ0" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="once saying" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>once saying</u></a>: “It’s not like I moved into her house.
