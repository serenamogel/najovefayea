Tom asks a lot of questions, and wants to understand every single piece of what’s going on. Arnold, if I started asking questions, he’d be like, “Better not to know.” And that’s very trusting. It’s not to say that one approach is better than the other, but it’s just night and day. Arnold is smoking cigars between takes, and Tom is working on the next seven scenes or doing push-ups or something.&nbsp;</p><p>They are complete opposites in their energy and how they approach the work, but they both show up knowing their lines, work really hard and do not let the crew waste any time on their behalf. Still, Arnold loves a good chess game, and he will not stop it for anything —&nbsp;literally anything. We even went into his trailer one day to sing him happy birthday, and he was like, “I have to finish this chess game.” And we’re like, “OK, and we’ll be outside,” and marched out with our candles.”</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Schwarzenegger and Cruse also have the benefit of immediately commanding respect from anyone in their orbit given what the pair have accomplished, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just don’t expect the Terminator legend to drop and give anybody 20 </a>when there’s a perfectly good stogie that needs to be smoked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKumn6Gxbr%2FMqKKeq12Ytqit0axkraedYrGwsdJmp66rmGLCsb%2BMrJqhr5Gnx6a6xKCenqpdlrulecKrrKKrlWKus7GMrqWsraKlv6q%2FyKeeZqegpby0tdOeqmaalanEprHNZquao5WofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
