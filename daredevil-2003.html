His mask extends over his eyes, which are not needed since his other senses fan out in a kind of radar, allowing him to visualize his surroundings and "see" things even in darkness.</p><p>By day (I love that "by day"), he is a lawyer in the Hell's Kitchen area of Manhattan. By night, he tells us, he prowls the alleys and rooftops, seeking out evildoers. Of these there is no shortage, although most of the city's more lucrative crime is controlled by the Kingpin (<a href=#>Michael Clarke Duncan</a>) and his chief minister, Bullseye (<a href=#>Colin Farrell</a>).</p><p>There must be a woman, and in "Daredevil" there is one (only one, among all those major make characters, although the fragrant <a href=#>Ellen Pompeo</a> has a slink-on). She is Elektra Natchios (<a href=#>Jennifer Garner</a>), who, like her classical namesake, wants to avenge the death of her father. By day, she is, well, pretty much as she is by night. She and Daredevil are powerfully attracted to each other, and even share some PG-13 sex, which is a relief because when superheroes have sex at the R level, I am always afraid someone will get hurt. There is a rather beautiful scene where he asks her to stand in the rain because his ears are so sensitive they can create an image of her face from the sound of the raindrops.</p><p>Matt Murdock's law partner is Franklin "Foggy" Nelson (<a href=#>Jon Favreau</a>). He has little suspicion of who he is sharing an office with, although he is a quick study. Another key character is Ben Urich (<a href=#>Joe Pantoliano</a>), who works for the New York Post, the newspaper of choice for superheroes.</p><p>Daredevil has the ability to dive off tall buildings, swoop through the air, bounce off stuff, land lightly and so forth. There is an explanation for this ability, but I tend to tune out such explanations because, after all, what do they really explain? I don't care what you say, it's Superman's cape that makes him fly. Comic fans, however, study the mythology and methodology with the intensity of academics. It is reassuring, in this world of inexplicabilities, to master a limited subject within a self-contained universe. Understand, truly understand, why Daredevil defies gravity, and the location of the missing matter making up 90 percent of the universe can wait for another day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46dmKudlJrDqriMa2dpaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
