He reminisced about the days spent filming the science fiction story and how it made him realize the “absurdity” of movies.</p><p>“One of the things I remember about that film, which I think it defines moviemaking and being an actor in movies totally, is that we were filming in Montreal in the dead of winter and Quebec winters are not for a slouch. It was freezing and yet we were shooting on a stage, a massive stage, that was heated to 80 degrees and then we were shooting in fake snow inside that stage pretending like we were freezing cold. [Laughs] That just sort of encapsulates the absurdity of what movies are and how you desperately need your imagination in order to make these things work.”</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=172 data-injectable=false>But at the same time, Gyllenhaal revealed he was also mesmerized by the massive creation of iconic oversized props and real-life locations to fit the plotline of the film.</p><p>“And also, there are these great moments of the size that movies can be, like the grand nature of making movies that is just so beautiful and I remember walking on set and there being the front steps of the New York City Public Library on a stage in Montreal and a water tank the size of, I don’t even know, it was just massive with cars submerged up to their windows and a thousand extras and a machine that could make a fake tsunami. I just thought, ‘This is just the best job.’”</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false>Gyllenhaal can currently be seen in Michael Bay’s Ambulance, playing in theatres now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooZqjlWK0urjLnqWhmZGherOxwpqjpatdl7yvt8SrqmarmKS8tXnFqKlmrJiaeqWt2GaYn6yVp3q1u8yoqaunp2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
