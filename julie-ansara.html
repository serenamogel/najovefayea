In the case of&nbsp;<strong>Matthew Ansara</strong>'s ex-wife<strong>, Julie Ansara,&nbsp;</strong>she also faced the same struggle in the time of separation with Matthew. The former pair are well-known personalities in the acting industry who won the hearts of millions with their talent.</p><p>Julie was born as&nbsp;<strong>Julie Karolyne Hoefer</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;26th March 1968,&nbsp;in Los Angeles, California, United States. She is an American by her nationality and belongs to white ethnicity/race. So, what's happening in Julie's daily life? Let's take a glimpse of Ansara's personal life.</p><h2>What's "Unveiled" Art Director, Julie's Marital Status?</h2><p>American art director, Julie is currently living a single life, but her fans are interested in her personal life. Nevertheless, she stays silent on her intimate details because of which her personal life is under the radar.</p><p>The&nbsp;52-year-old, Ansara is still working prominently with focusing on her upcoming projects without appearing in the media's attention. She might be busy on her day-to-day work rather than focusing on her dating life.</p><h2>Julie & Matthew Ansara's Past Married Life</h2><p><i>Unveiled&nbsp;</i>cast member, Ansara has kept the most memorable experiences with her late ex-husband,&nbsp;<strong>Matthew Ansara,&nbsp;</strong>an actor. The two walked down the aisle in a private ceremony on&nbsp;<i>24th July 1993</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/9/Picture-1578567849100.jpg><p>Upon their blissful marriage, the pair shared a glimpse of happiness for more than three years in their marital life. But then, the couple's relationship started facing troubles, which led them to file for divorce in&nbsp;<i>1995,&nbsp;</i>citing irreconcilable differences.</p><h2>Julie's Late Ex-Husband, Matthew's Affair with Leanna Green</h2><p>Ansara's former spouse, Matthew started dating&nbsp;<strong>Leanna Green&nbsp;</strong>after divorcing with Julie. The duo had their first interaction in&nbsp;<i>1997&nbsp;</i>and eventually started dating from a while.</p><p>After dating for more than three and a half years, the couple got engaged and sat their wedding date on&nbsp;<i>1st September 2001</i>. Unfortunately, the duo's wedding later called-off after the demise of Matthew on&nbsp;<i>25th June 2001&nbsp;</i>due to accidental heroin overdose in Los Angeles, California.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/1/9/Picture-1578567661118.jpg><p>Following the untimely death, Matthew was buried at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park located in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, California.

She earns a decent salary from her profession. In the United States, an art director makes average earnings of&nbsp;<strong>$66,407&nbsp;</strong>annually.
