Indiana has the Pacers, though, and Kentucky doesn't have an NBA team, and I don't think they've ever had one.<h2>Why doesn't Tampa have an NBA team?</h2>Tampa-St.<p>Petersburg was the temporary home of the Toronto Raptors, who played home games at Amalie Arena for the 2020-21 season due to COVID-19 concerns. In 1993, Tampa lobbied the NBA for an expansion franchise but was rejected because of the Orlando Magic's footprint in the region.</p><h2>Does Georgia have a NBA team?</h2>The Atlanta Hawks are an American professional basketball team based in Atlanta.

They only became a two-team city in 1984 when the Clips moved up the road from San Diego—in large part because Sterling grew up in LA. Sterling was a polarizing figure who has had articles and books written about his time running the team (poorly, I might add).<h2>Does North Carolina have a professional basketball team?</h2>Charlotte Hornets, American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina, that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA).<h2>Does Washington state have a basketball team?</h2>2021-22 Washington State Cougars Roster - College Basketball Players - CBSSports.com.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lo6mutbGMnaaeq12jvLV5x5qtnmWRYrujrYytnJql</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
