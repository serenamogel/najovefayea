Admitting that it is “always tough to get any details in regards to how the dates with the parents went or who had which date first and stuff like that,” the human Bachelor Nation encyclopedia revealed that Joey Graziadei gives Daisy Kent the final rose nonetheless, and the two lovebirds are engaged as of January 2024.</p><p data-characters=673 data-current-count=673 data-injectable=true>“Just like every season, people will question, people will doubt, and contestants will post stuff on social media to throw fans off. It happens every season [and] this one will be no different, but come finale night, this is what you’ll see. Joey and Daisy got engaged in Tulum, Mexico at the end of the season. Obviously the finale won’t air until mid-March, so who knows what can happen in the next four months, but this is how the season ended,” Reality Steve explained, before revealing that he will not expose any of the sources that helped him draw this conclusion, however, he is confident that this is how season 28 of The Bachelor comes to a close.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>Given that Reality Steve’s predictions are correct almost 100 percent of the time — and have been for years and years — it is safe to trust his judgement.

Because of this, the 25-year-old has become an activist for hearing loss by writing a children’s book titled Daisy Doo All The Sounds She Knew, as well as starting her own nonprofit organization called Hear Your Heart, which was “created to help support children who have autoimmune disorders or hearing loss” by providing children “medical assistance, funds for future education, and bringing awareness to mental health for children and families.” How incredible is that?</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>To watch the love story between Joey Graziadei and Daisy Kent unfold from the very beginning, catch the premiere of&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;season 28 on ABC on Monday, January 22.
