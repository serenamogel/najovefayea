A second costar, Conlan Carter (born 1934), portrayed the legal assistant, C.E. Carruthers. Carter later joined the cast of ABC's Combat!.Thereafter, De Gore played the young widow Louise Howard, the attractive romantic interest of Richard Crenna (1927–2003) in his revised role as the recently widowed Luke McCoy on CBS' The Real McCoys. The situation comedy starring Walter Brennan had premiered on ABC in 1957 but switched networks and nights from Thursday to Sunday opposite Bonanza on NBC for its final year. Kathleen Nolan, who played Crenna's on-screen wife, Kate McCoy, left the series after five years; it was announced that Nolan's character had died. Butch Patrick, later of CBS's The Munsters, played Greg Howard, Louise's 9-year-old son, in the revised The McCoys.Most of De Gore's acting occurred between 1952 and 1966. Her early roles were in dramatic anthologies, including Hallmark Hall of Fame, the Philco Television Playhouse, and Kraft Television Theatre. In 1960-1961, as she joined Four Star's The Law and Mr. Jones cast, she also appeared in episodes of two Warner Brothers series, Will Hutchins' western Sugarfoot and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.'s detective series, 77 Sunset Strip, both on ABC.In 1964, she appeared as a flight attendant in the episode "Second Chance" of the ABC science fiction series The Outer Limits. In 1965, she appeared on Chuck Connors' short-lived NBC western Branded. In 1966, her last year of television credits, De Gore appeared on The Farmer's Daughter (ABC) with Inger Stevens, Perry Mason (CBS) with Raymond Burr, and NBC's powerhouse western Bonanza, which had destroyed The McCoys in the 1962-1963 ratings. Her Bonanza role on the episode entitled "Tommy" was that of Allie Miller.She is believed to reside in the Greater Los Angeles Area. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=2><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1930</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Larchmont, New York, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actress</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nicknames</td><td>Janet De Gore, De Gore, Janet</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Living in the greater Los Angeles area (2009).</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actress <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actress readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Bonanza</td><td>1966</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Allie Miller</td></tr><tr><td>Perry Mason</td><td>1966</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Lisabeth Wells</td></tr><tr><td>The Farmer's Daughter</td><td>1966</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Mary McNamara</td></tr><tr><td>Branded</td><td>1965</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Sally Colbee</td></tr><tr><td>The Outer Limits</td><td>1964</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Mara Matthews</td></tr><tr><td>The Real McCoys</td><td>1963</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Louise Howard</td></tr><tr><td>Saints and Sinners</td><td>1963</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Gloria</td></tr><tr><td>The Law and Mr. Jones</td><td>1960-1962</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Marsha Spear</td></tr><tr><td>77 Sunset Strip</td><td>1961</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Shawn Waters</td></tr><tr><td>Sugarfoot</td><td>1960</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Mrs. Mary Kirk</td></tr><tr><td>Armstrong Circle Theatre</td><td>1958</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Schlitz Playhouse</td><td>1956</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Ponds Theater</td><td>1954</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Dee</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse</td><td>1954</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Mary Catherine</td></tr><tr><td>Father Time</td><td>1952</td><td>TV Movie</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sometimes She's Sunday</td><td>1952</td><td>TV Movie</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Goodyear Playhouse</td><td>1952</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Kraft Theatre</td><td>1949-1951</td><td>TV Series</td><td></td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>The Law and Mr. Jones (1960-1962)<br>as Marsha Spear</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>The Real McCoys (1963)<br>as Louise Howard</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Sometimes She's Sunday (1952)<br>as Actress</p></figure><figure class=gallery-item readability=1><p>Father Time (1952)<br>as Actress</p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqecrWWnpL%2B1tI6jmKedpGKxpnnGqKmeZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
