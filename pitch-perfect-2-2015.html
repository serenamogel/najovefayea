Again, that results in one of “Pitch 2’s” high points, involving Fat Amy belting <a href=#>Pat Benatar</a>’s “We Belong” while rocking a rather unsteady watercraft.</p><p>But for every moment of cleverness (among them, the treatment of the Universal Studios fanfare and this Fat Amy aside: “You’re the most talented person I know, and I’ve met three of the Wiggles—intimately”), there seems to be a half-dozen attempts at humor that strain for laughs. Most of the eclectic array of Bellas return, their once-endearing quirks now employed more broadly but to lesser effect. Low talker Lily (<a href=#>Hana Mae Lee</a>) is scarier than ever as she whispers such non sequiturs as “All my teeth come from other people.” Upbeat leader Chloe (<a href=#>Brittany Snow</a>) is still plagued by insecurity in her seventh year of college (she intentionally fails Russian lit to continue singing with the Bellas).&nbsp;</p><p>Among the newcomers, there’s <a href=#>Hailee Steinfeld</a> (“True Grit”)—probably being groomed to take over from fellow Oscar nominee Kendrick—as pleasant legacy Emily (her mom is played by <a href=#>Katey Sagal</a>) who possesses a nice lilting tone. Her major contribution to the Bellas, however, is her ability to introduce original material into their repertoire. Her tune “Flashlight” (actual writers include the superhot Sia and Sam Smith) is aiming to be the new “Cups,” but is more similar to Rihanna’s ode to another utilitarian implement, “Umbrella.” Unfortunately, Emily’s last name is Junk. The punchlines practically write themselves.</p><p>As for the a capella performances, there is something a little prefab and not as organic as those in the first film.&nbsp; However, just as the impromptu sing-off in an empty pool was the musical standout in the first “Pitch,” so, too, is the one held at the mansion of a rich a cappella nut (<a href=#>David Cross</a>) between top groups, including some of the beefier members of the Green Bay Packers—just one of a parade of star cameos. If you can’t enjoy hearing a medley of songs about appreciating large backsides (among them, “Thong Song,” “Baby Got Back” and “Bootylicious”) done in multi-part harmony, there is no pleasing you.</p><p>Alas, the final showdown is a letdown. It is always wise to give some leeway to comedies PC-wise, but even my usually open mind started shutting down when a montage of the global talent going up against the Bellas looked more like a stereotype-heavy homage to “It’s a Small World After All.” And, as much as it pains me to say this, I would have given the honors to Das Music Machine. Even if they are, according to Fat Amy, “Deustchbags.”&nbsp;</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46poK2bmGK9pr7FnpqtZWJif3F9lA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
