This was accomplished because Rize’s organs were transferred into his body, so he must consume human flesh to survive, just as ghouls do. In his new life as a half-ghoul, he is taken in by the ghouls who run the coffee shop Anteiku. It is difficult for him to fit into the ghoul society, as well as keep his identity hidden from his human companions, especially from Hideyoshi Nagachika, his best friend.</p><p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>With Kaneki’s journey as the protagonist, this series thrives because of the main character’s development and psychological profile.

Unlike some of these other entries, Made in Abyss is primarily a fantasy-adventure series that, all of a sudden, sucker punches you with the most gut-wrenching horror when you’ve already grown comfortable and complacent in the story. Around Episode 10 of Season 1, if you’re not devoid of feeling, Made in Abyss will pull and twist at your heartstrings. As a Redditor put it:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/SuperiorCardboardBox</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>anime</a></figure><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>“Watch at your own risk”, is a just warning to give anyone brave to go into the depths of the Abyss with our two protagonists. The series’ soundtrack is also something out of this world, which befits one of the most spectacular settings to be seen in an anime. Although it might not be for the faint of heart, Made in Abyss is a journey worth witnessing with one’s own eyes and with as few prior spoilers as possible.</p><h2 id=h-2-kowabon data-injectable=false>2. Kowabon</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Made in 2015,&nbsp;Kowabon&nbsp;is a fascinating miniseries with a unique visual style. The series contains 13 three-minute episodes, each telling a different story about a ghost tormenting someone. Each of these stories is shown via an in-universe camera, from webcams to security cameras, giving a fascinating, almost voyeuristic found-footage feeling to the show.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>However, what stands out the most is&nbsp;Kowabon’s&nbsp;rotoscoped animation. This gives everything a strange vibe, recognizable while also being otherwordly, which only helps to intensify the scares, meaning each short will leave you shaken despite its short length.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-1-theatre-of-darkness-yamishibai data-injectable=false>1. Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false>Starting in 2013,&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;has been running for over 118 episodes. Each episode of&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;is only four minutes long, and each tells a different ghost story, many of which are based on Japanese myths and legends. This means that the show has a lot of variety with scares of all kinds, from ghosts to monsters.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=860 data-injectable=true>What makes&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;stand out is its visual style. It is designed to emulate the look of Kamishibai, a form of performance that became popular in the 1930s. Usually performed on street corners, Kamishibai features a narrator telling a story using a series of hand-painted wooden boards as illustrations. The animators of&nbsp;Yamishibai&nbsp;did a fantastic job of emulating this visual style, which helped it create many memorable scenes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=401 data-injectable=false>In addition, the writing is superb, with the stories able to leave a lasting impact despite only running for a few minutes each time. In fact, the concise nature of the stories is often to their advantage, leaving the hauntings mostly unexplained, adding to the fear factor. So if you’re looking for quick scares,&nbsp;Theatre of Darkness: Yamishibai&nbsp;is precisely what you need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY5qamaalajBbrTOq6moql2Wu6q5xGamp2WTp8Kvr8eyqaiknGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
