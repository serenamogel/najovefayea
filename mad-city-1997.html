As it is, it's too predictable: A media circus springs up when the museum guard, a likable everyman played by <a href=#>John Travolta</a>, creates a hostage crisis and finds himself bonding with a TV newsman (<a href=#>Dustin Hoffman</a>). The movie is obviously inspired by “<a href=#>Ace in the Hole</a>,” the knife-edged 1951 satire from <a href=#>Billy Wilder</a>, about a man trapped in a cave and the broken-down newsman (<a href=#>Kirk Douglas</a>) who spins out the crisis to rescue his own career. But while Wilder's movie was smart and ironic, “Mad City” is dumbed down into a roundup of the usual suspects: the old-fashioned news director, the egotistical network star, the young intern on the make, etc. <a href=#>Costa-Gavras</a>, who directed the film, should have remembered that satire depends on exaggeration, not attack.</p><p>As the film opens, Hoffman is at the museum to cover a story when Travolta walks in and demands a hearing with his boss (<a href=#>Blythe Danner</a>). He's been fired from his low-wage job, and wants it back. The guard is not too bright, and has brought along a duffel bag containing a shotgun and sticks of dynamite--to get her attention, he says. Soon he has inadvertently taken a group of children hostage, and accidentally shot his best friend, another guard. He's having the kind of day <a href=#>Jim Carrey</a> might have scripted.</p><p>Hoffman was once a network star, but after running afoul of an egomaniacal anchor (<a href=#>Alan Alda</a>), he's been exiled to the sticks. This is the big story that can rebuild his career. He stays inside the museum, broadcasting from a battery-powered lapel mike, and over the course of long hours and nights he becomes friends with the hapless guard, who only wanted his job back and is terrified that now his wife will be mad at him.</p><p>Hoffman's performance is on target, and would have served a better screenplay. Alan Alda also has some well-observed moments as the star anchorman.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46mmJ1lk57BunmQcnBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
