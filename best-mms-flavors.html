Chocolate in a candy shell with a roasty peanut inside or a dab of peanut butter is heavenly. Everyone has strongly held M&M’s opinions and preferences, but before you yell at me about this ranking, consider that I tried all of these M&M’s varieties back to back and also consulted the rest of the pros on the Sporked team too. You may disagree with the hierarchy, but can we all agree that M&M’s are pretty great?</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

A movie theater companion for the ages. The ideal marriage of chocolate and legume. I eat these in a very particular way: I bisect them with my teeth and eat half the chocolate and half the shell; then my second bite is whole peanut, plus half chocolate and half shell, which, in my opinion, gives you the perfect ratio of components. A two-bite food! The shell is sweet and crunchy; the chocolate and roasty peanut pair perfectly. And now that I’m an M&M’s history buff, I can tell you that Peanut M&M’s came along in 1954, just 13 years after original M&M’s—a classic for a reason.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>10/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best M&M's flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BEST-MM-FLAVOR-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Modern Classic</p><strong>Peanut Butter M&M’s</strong><p>I will always choose Peanut M&M’s over Peanut Butter M&M’s, but I have to admit that these are extremely good, especially for an occasional change of pace. The peanut butter within these big boys is oily and salty. And the peanut butter-to-chocolate ratio is good, albeit just a touch on light side in terms of filling. Still, totally delicious. It’s a toss up for number one, truly.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best M&M's flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BEST-MM-FLAVOR-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Plain</p><strong>M&M’s Minis</strong><p>Okay, hear me out: M&M’s Minis are a more perfect version of a plain M&M. Their more delicate shell gives them a crispier crunch and a more ideal shell-to-chocolate ratio. Plus, they come in a tube and you can just pour them directly into your maw. I don’t love the extra waste the plastic tube creates, but the tubes are actually useful if you hang onto and reuse them. Plus, there’s a justification: These dainty lil guys would get absolutely pulverized in a regular bag. If you don’t care for additions to your M&M’s, give these a shot.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best M&M's flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BEST-MM-FLAVOR-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best New Innovation</p><strong>Fudge Brownie M&M’s</strong><p>I try pretty much every new M&M’s flavor when it comes out, and I’ll just say that my hopes weren’t incredibly high for these. But, wow, they blew me away. These are bigger and a little more misshapen than a lot of M&M’s you’re used to—kind of like lumpy Peanut Butter M&M’s. Inside, there’s a fudgey little brownie bit surrounded by chocolate and shell, and that thing is so good! They actually managed to channel the flavor of a baked good into a tiny morsel that adds chew and a deeper chocolatey flavor to the entire candy. I brought a gigantic bag of these home with me and polished off the entire thing in record time. These are also a two-bite food, which I love.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Vons</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best M&M's flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BEST-MM-FLAVOR-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Chew</p><strong>Caramel M&M’s</strong><p>I honestly didn’t know I wanted chew from my M&M’s until this taste test. Like Fudge Brownie, these M&M’s have a nice, squishy interior that really improves the entire textural experience. I think I’d always avoided Caramel M&M’s because I assumed they’d be too nauseatingly sweet. Not the case. I also wasn’t sure if they’d contain the drizzly kind of caramel or the good, chewy kind of caramel. It’s the latter. Best case scenario all around! I noted that the caramel flavor is a little bit artificial tasting, but that didn’t prevent me from wanting to continue housing these until my stomach hurt.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best M&M's flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BEST-MM-FLAVOR-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_06.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Crunchy</p><strong>Crunchy Cookie M&M’s</strong><p>Now, I think these would be 1,000 times better if the cookie inside were chewy like the morsel inside the Fudge Brownie M&M’s, but do Crunchy Cookie M&M’s deliver on their promise? They sure do. As advertised, these have a great cookie crunch and a nice sugar cookie-esque flavor that compliments the chocolate. Also, if you’re a fan of slowly dismantling snacks like this with your teeth, you’ll have a blast with these since you can get the cookie morsel out entirely intact and eat it on its own. A candy and an activity in one!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Target</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="white chocolate m&ms " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/BEST-MM-FLAVOR-RANKING_JORDAN-MYRICK_SPORKED_INSET_07.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best White</p><strong>White Chocolate M&Ms</strong><p>There are lots of people who prefer white chocolate to dark and milk chocolate. In fact, Sporked editorial assistant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naajia Shukri</a> is one of them. No judgement here. I like and certainly get the creamy appeal of white chocolate, and that’s why these ranked over the other white chocolate M&M’s we tried. With Peanut White Chocolate M&M’s, the flavor of the peanut is really the star of the show and the white chocolate flavor kind of gets lost. We also tried White Chocolate Key Lime Pie M&M’s, which are great, but have a bold lime flavor that sets them apart entirely. Plus, no way can I eat a whole bag of those lime guys. These plain White Chocolate M&M’s are made to eat by the bagful, and I appreciate that.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Sarah Demonteverde / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> White Chocolate Peanut M&M’s, Dark Chocolate Peanut M&M’s, Pretzel M&M’s, Dark Chocolate Mint M&M’s, White Chocolate Key Lime Pie M&M’s</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Film your own taste test at home and share with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuucysZJ%2Bkkau8s7%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
