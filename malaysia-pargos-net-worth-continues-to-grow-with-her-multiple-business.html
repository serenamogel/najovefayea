In 2011, she debuted on reality television with Basketball Wives: Los Angeles. In February 2021, she returned for the ninth season of Basketball Wives on VH1. The socialite, however, did not earn the moniker “basketball wife” on her own. She obtained it due to her marriage to former NBA player Jannero Pargo.</p><p>After eight years of marriage, the couple filed for divorce in 2014. But that didn’t stop her from becoming one of television’s most successful personalities. Since her divorce from Jannero, she has prioritized her children, reality TV career, and businesses, which have enabled her to amass a sizable fortune.</p><p>She has a net worth of $3.5 million as of 2023, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Aside from her business, a sizable divorce settlement has boosted her asset valuation. Let’s look at how the reality TV diva made her money.</p><h2>Pargo Is A Successful business owner.</h2><p>If you’ve seen the show, you’ve probably noticed her flawless hair, skin, and lashes. Unsurprisingly, she works in the hair, skin, and lash industry. After launching a bedding line with Hedgecock Creed, she collaborated with Urban Skin RX in 2019 to create a Skin Quench Oxygen Gel Mask.</p><p>“At first, I was a customer of Urban Skin Rx. I had used their products and knew that their formulas were effective. “I became a fan of the brand, and I did more research with my love of skincare,” Pargo told ESSENCE in 2019.</p><p>Malaysia X Urban Skin Rx Skin Quench Oxygen Gel Mask is a hyaluronic-rich cleansing mask that is intended to deep clean pores, smooth texture, and brighten skin. She also worked with The Virgin Hair Fantasy on her lashes and hair.</p><p>The Basketball Wives star is also the founder of the Vanity World ladies’ clothing line. Pargo is frequently seen on Instagram wearing amazing outfits from her clothing line as a form of promotion.</p><p>In honor of her three children, she named her jewelry line Three Beats Custom Children’s Jewelry. Pargo is also an actress, having appeared in the film Ludacris: Splash Waterfalls (2004) and the television series The Eric Andre Show (2012).</p><h2>Extensive Divorce Settlement</h2><p>According to Bossip, Pargo received a sizable settlement in her divorce from her former NBA husband in 2016, which contributed to her massive net worth. She allegedly received a 2015 Mercedes-Benz G550, 50 percent of Jannero’s NBA player pension plan, half of his NBA 401K savings plan, all rights to the firm 3 Beats LLC, access to three checking accounts, and a money market account as part of the settlement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000635113966-1.jpg><p>Jannero was also said to be paying $14,580 in child support and $800 in child care for the couple’s three children — a son born in 2007 and twins born in 2011. According to the publishing house, the former couple is entitled to keep their furniture, jewelry, and any money they have earned since their 2014 divorce. However, the amount of money in the bank accounts and pension plan was unknown<strong>. Jannero pays Pargo $7,500 in spousal support for about a year before their divorce was finalized.</strong></p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table class=wp-block-table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Original name</strong></td><td>Malaysia Pargo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>By Name</strong></td><td>Malaysia Pargo</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Main Profession</strong></td><td>Television personality</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Born In</strong></td><td>Compton, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birthday</strong></td><td>12-Aug-80</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age&nbsp;</strong></td><td>42 years old</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heights</strong></td><td>1.80 m</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height(s) Feet</strong></td><td>5 feet and 10 inches</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Heights in cm</strong></td><td>180 cm</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight(s)</strong></td><td>66 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Weight in Pound</strong></td><td>145 pounds</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Dates with</strong></td><td>To be Updated</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Married/Single/Divorced</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spouse</strong></td><td>Jannero Pargo (m. 20062014)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Son/Daughter</strong></td><td>Yes (3 Children)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Income</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$5 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqSRrsCqrYypmKufn6h6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqS7za2gp62VqHq1u4ygqaivXay2tbSMoZyrZZ2qubW1z6WcZpqlqLavsdKsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
