In 1873, on an island off the coast of New Hampshire, two Norwegian immigrant women are found murdered with an ax. A hapless man named Wagner (<a href=#>Ciaran Hinds</a>) is convicted of the crime after a surviving eyewitness named Maren (<a href=#>Sarah Polley</a>) testifies against him.</p><p>By the end of the movie, we will have a deeper understanding of the emotional undertow on the island, and we will know that Maren's love for her brother Evan (<a href=#>Anders W. Berthelsen</a>) is at the center of the intrigue.</p><p>Maren is married to John Hontvedt (<a href=#>Ulrich Thomsen</a>) but does not love him; her brother arrives on the island with his new bride Anethe (<a href=#>Vinessa Shaw</a>), and there is also her sister Karen (<a href=#>Katrin Cartlidge</a>, whose performance is a reminder of how much we lost when she died at such an early age).</p><p>The modern story takes place mostly on a luxury yacht chartered by two brothers, Thomas and Rich Janes (<a href=#>Sean Penn</a> and <a href=#>Josh Lucas</a>). Thomas' wife, Jean (<a href=#>Catherine McCormack</a>), is a famous photographer who is working on a book about the famous crime, which still inspires controversy and revisionist theories. The others are along for the ride, including Rich's girlfriend, Adaline (<a href=#>Elizabeth Hurley</a>). We learn, by indirection, tones of voice and body language, that the Penn character is jealous of his brother, indifferent to his wife, interested in the girlfriend.</p><p>The screenplay, by <a href=#>Alice Arlen</a> and <a href=#>Christopher Kyle</a>, doesn't try to force awkward parallels between the two stories, but they are there to be found: hidden and forbidden passion, sibling jealousy, the possibility of violence. The movie tells the two stories so separately, indeed, that each one acts as a distraction from the other. The fact that there are nine major characters and many lines of intrigue doesn't help; "Possession" and "The French Lieutenant's Woman" only had to deal with parallels between a 19th century couple and a 20th century couple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lp5q2qLTTZqafZaeWwaa%2BjGtnaWo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
