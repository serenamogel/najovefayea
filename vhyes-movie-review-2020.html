When Ralph gets a camera for Christmas in 1987, and learns that he can record from the TV, it opens a world of possibilities. Namely, whatever he can find on the TV that is weird to him at the time. In one of its many abrupt, fuzzy cuts, an excited young Ralph jumps on his bed and&nbsp;says that he wants to create the ultimate video playlist, and soon into watching “VHYes” you accept that that’s all you’re going to get.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of feeling like the chaos of a found tape, “VHYes” assembles itself like a series of&nbsp;sketches that it can bounce between, with random peeks back at the original wedding video contents; it struggles to have a heart&nbsp;by intermittently making it a story about Ralph realizing the truth behind his parents' marriage. Some sketch set-ups are directly, lazily recognizable to TV history: one cop parody steals the red and blue text from “Law and Order” because you wouldn’t get that it’s meant to parody if it didn’t have that logo. As if a tell on its weak absurdity, "VHYes" has yet another parody on TV painting instructor&nbsp;Bob Ross (even after Deadpool did it), with a segment starring <a href=#>Kerri Kenney</a>, who&nbsp;turns the zen of such a host into the mindset of a creepy person who believes in aliens.&nbsp;</p><p>The very nostalgia within the concept becomes a pit, even when “VHYes” threatens to get truly weird. It’s not until the final minutes that the movie taps into the reality-bending that had been hinted at earlier, when Ralph started to see himself in the stuff he was watching, after one segment involved a VHS expert talking about the soul-suck that will be handheld recording in the future. Many parody sketches don’t have a discernible reference to build on (the recognition is what makes it initially funny), and instead rely on a shallow cheesiness. Even though "VHYes" features many dynamic funny people like Kenney, <a href=#>Thomas Lennon</a>, Mark Prosch, Charlyne&nbsp;Yi, and Robbins' parents (<a href=#>Tim Robbins</a> and <a href=#>Susan Sarandon</a>), many of&nbsp;the characters in these sketches are so broad they aren't particularly clever.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46vn7Kdo2K6sMLInmSrnaaesrh5kWlpaQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
