Recommended Videos On the surface, the two films seem like complete opposites. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if the dour Blade Runner 2049 got some kind of box office boost had it released at the same time as Barbie. In a parallel universe, the ironic Barbenheimer trend could have been replaced with “Barbie Runner 2049."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised if the dour Blade Runner 2049 got some kind of box office boost had it released at the same time as Barbie. In a parallel universe, the ironic Barbenheimer trend could have been replaced with “Barbie Runner 2049.” One movie is a bubble gum summer pop extravaganza, and another resembles a nightmarish vision of our near future.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>However, things get spooky when you start to think about the connections for a second: both films star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Gosling</a> with character names that start with a “K.” Both are set in Los Angeles and depict the city in a somewhat dystopian manner. What’s more, the replicants in the Blade Runner universe are somewhat reminiscent of the dolls that come to life in Barbie.</p><p data-characters=192 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>These dots were first connected by a Reddit user on the r/FanTheories subreddit in a post that makes a convincing argument for a pretty compelling Barbie sequel, and Blade Runner 2049 prequel.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Barbie is a prequel to blade runner 2049 let me explain…</a><br>by<a href=#>u/Important-Command-69</a> in<a href=#>FanTheories</a></figure><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>With Ken being broken hearted at the end of the events of Barbie, when the titular doll decides to leave Barbieland and begin her life as a woman in the real world, Ken went from smiling all the time to always frowning after the events of the film. This explains the unrelenting sour expression on the renamed K’s face throughout the events of Blade Runner 2049, as the post explains.</p><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>Of course, the cherry on top of this fan theory is that the evil Tyrell Corporation are the ones who “seized” Barbieland, enslaved its residents, wiped their memories clean, and proceeded to reverse-engineer the seemingly magical dolls to perfect their replicant design. The only real nit pick that I can find in the theory is the simple fact that the original Blade Runner film actually takes place in 2019. This would mean the events of the first Blade Runner movie actually took place before Barbie in the chronology, and that replicants already existed in this world.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>Regardless, I am extremely pumped to see a fan-made “Barbie Runner” follow-up that concretely ties the two universes together and serves as a sequel to Barbie and a threequel to the Blade Runner franchise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZeus67InmStoJWkv7p51p6tnmWRoblursSepWavkZ7BqrrGZp2oql2cv6bAwGaenqqnnrS0ecGlppyjkqrAtbHRZqOemZSoeqq606hkm6SRmbJuvtSnpZ6qXWd9dYWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
