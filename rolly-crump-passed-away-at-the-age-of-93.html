The ad referred to him as an “absolutely one-of-a-kind person” whose “whimsical” work was well-known around the globe. It was stated:</p><p>“Whether it was his numerous efforts to Walt Disney films and amusement parks, his work for various pop culture icons (such as Ernie Ball and Jacques Cousteau), or his personal artwork, Rolly’s amazing style was immediately familiar to many.”</p><p>The article stated that Rolly Crump worked for The Walt Disney Corporation for a long period and added to exhibits such as The Enchanted Tiki Room, The Haunted Mansion, It’s A Small World and others. He also worked for Knott’e Berry Farm, Busch Gardens, the Prince of Oman, and others, according to the ad. The article ended with the following:</p><p>“Rolly and his family would like to appreciate the supporters for their years of support. His entire life was filled with one “kind of a charming tale after another,” and he will be recalled fondly.”</p><h2>Rolly Crump was well-known for his work with Walt Disney Productions.</h2><p>Rolly Crump, who was born on February 27, 1930, began sketching when he was three years old. Candice Elizabeth Ivie, the assistant of the film company 20th Century Fox, reared him. His grandma also studied at the Art Institute of Chicago.&nbsp;Crump was a huge admirer of Disney’s Silly Symphony animations as a kid, as well as other films. Rolly Crump married Leona Deiman in 1949 and the couple had three children before entering The Walt Disney Corporation in 1952.
