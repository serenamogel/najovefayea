Thomas was widely criticised for competing in the NCAA finals, when the biological man won the 500 yard women’s final. In a February letter addressed to the NCAA, sixteen of Thomas’s teammates asked that Thomas be disqualified from competing. “Obviously I know how I felt and I knew how my teammates felt, but no one really wanted to talk about it,” Gaines told Fox News."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

And that next day we came back and the mood had shifted to where people were mad, the girls, you know, there were tears.”</p><p>In first place, Thomas swam finished at 4:33.24s, according to results&nbsp;published&nbsp;on <a href=#>swimmeetresults.tech</a>.

Gaines claimed at the time that forcing her to compete against Thomas was unjust and that most other female athletes she knew felt the same way. Gaines claimed she and her teammates were confident the NCAA wouldn’t allow Thomas to compete in the women’s national championships with unfair physical advantages like height, muscle mass, and heart and lung size after learning that Thomas had competed in the men’s division for the previous three seasons before making the transition to a woman.</p><p>Also Read|<a href=#>“Female athletes are not okay with this”: Riley Gaines denied trophy over transgender swimmer Lia Thomas</a></p><p>Also read| <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Four to six hour window where I cannot remember anything”: Mary-Sophie Harvey alleges being drugged at 2022 Swimming World C’ships</a></p><p>Do follow us on:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xaipnJ2UYsGwedGamp5lkZyuqrrSrWSaZZ2WuaZ5xZ6kmqSVYsC4tcymnKtlop65psWMoJiippWoeq2t0qGcrGWfqsFurcaaoKerpGLBs63NrJ6eppSav26%2F1qKkpp2iYrmqrYytn6ilkah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
