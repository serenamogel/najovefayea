A new clip from Loki Season 2 features an easter egg that appears to connect the God of Mischief to the Fist of Khonshu’s own Disney+ series. The clip shows a TVA clerk, Casey—first introduced in Loki Season 1—listening to the Staying Awake podcast, the same podcast one of Moon Knight’s personalities, Steven Grant, listens to in Moon Knight.</p><p><strong>An Easter egg in Loki Season 2 hints that Oscar Isaac’s Moon Knight could make an appearance.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The Easter egg is more than just a podcast namedrop, however. When Casey takes his headphones off the line, “Solving puzzles is a great way to keep your mind…” can be heard. This same phrase can be heard in the scene where Oscar Issac plays with a Rubik’s cube while trying to stay awake in an episode of Moon Knight.</p><p><strong>Most of the Disney+ Marvel shows—as well as the last few Marvel movies—have been criticized somewhat for not having the same synergy as early Phases of the MCU.</strong></p><p>While this could be nothing more than a fun easter egg like the <a href=#>Infinity Stones</a> in Loki Season 1, it’s more likely that it’s a clue planted to set something up down the road.</p><p>Most of the Disney+ Marvel shows—as well as the last few Marvel movies—have been criticized somewhat for not having the same synergy as early Phases of the MCU. This easter egg could signify that things are about to change in that respect, especially since Disney proved with Loki Season 1 that the series is the preferred platform for setting up major plot points in the MCU.</p><p><a href=#>Loki </a>Season 1 served as an introduction to the MCU’s next Thanos-level baddie, Kang the Conquerer. It would only make sense for the second season to also have serious repercussions for the rest of the MCU—including Oscar Isaac’s dissociative identity disorder-plagued vigilante Moon Knight.</p><p><strong>Even a single scene where the two entities meet would be enough to light a spark and ignite the fan’s excitement for a potential.</strong></p><p>Moon Knight itself is no stranger to easter eggs. In the third episode of the Disney+ series, Oscar Isaac, as Moon Knight personality Marc Spector, fights a thug wearing a Jacket with the same color scheme as Kang the Conquerer and featuring an Egyptian Pharaoh on the back. The Pharoah is a reference to one of Kang’s better-known variants, Rama-Tut, who made an appearance as part of the Council of Kangs in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania‘s post-credit scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Moon-Knight-Superhero-Oscar-Issac-Marvel-Publicity-H-2022-900x507.png><p>This could mean that Moon Knight, with his connection to Egypt through the god Khonshu, is destined to run into Rama-Tut at some point, and while it’s pure speculation at the moment, it’s easy to picture that confrontation taking place during Loki Season 2. As of right now, a second season of Moon Knight isn’t a sure thing at Marvel. It’s been rumored, however, that should Oscar Isaac and Marvel sign off on a Moon Knight Season 2, Kang will be involved somehow.</p><p>Should that rumor turn out to be true—and with the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike and Johnathon Majors legal woes, it’s certainly not guaranteed—there is no better place to set up a second season than by having Oscar Isaac’s Moon Knight show up in Loki along with Rama-Tut.</p><p>Even a single scene where the two entities meet would be enough to light a spark and ignite the fan’s excitement for a potential. Moon Knight Season 2. But we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves. As awesome as it would be to see Oscar Isaac don his Moon Knight attire for a second season of lunar-themed heroics, we still have to get through Loki Season 2 first.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ino5ius3nIrJiam12ivLC6jKSlop%2BYqXqtu8qiZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
