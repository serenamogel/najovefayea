Guard say Pan-Pan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Any mariners wishing to render assistance should contact the Coast Guard on Channel 16.” Pan-pan is <b>the international urgency call indicating</b> that someone aboard a boat is declaring an urgent situation that is not an immediate threat to either the vessel or the people on board.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-the-coast-guard-say-securitay></span>Why does the Coast Guard say Securitay?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Sécurité: A <b>radio call that usually issues navigational warnings, meteorological warnings</b>, and any other warning needing to be issued that may concern the safety of life at sea, yet may not be particularly life-threatening. Pan-pan: This is the second most important call.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-pon-pon-deadliest-catch></span>What is Pon Pon deadliest catch?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A huge arctic storm is on top of them and the coast guard has just called out pon-pon-pon which is <b>notification of an emergency</b>, but one that is not as severe as a mayday. A ship sinking is a mayday; a ship stuck on the beach is a pon-pon-pon.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-it-pan-pan-or-pon-pon></span>Is it Pan-Pan or Pon Pon?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>It’s spelled Pan Pan but pronounced Pon Pon</b>, go figure.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-it-illegal-to-use-a-marine-radio-on-land></span>Why is it illegal to use a marine radio on land?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Marine radios can function on land; however, because marine radios are used by vessels in situations of distress, navigational issues, personal communication, and business needs, <b>it is not legal for a person to use a marine radio</b> on land without an approved coast station license.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-should-the-stand-on-vessel-do></span>What should the stand on vessel do?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Stand-on vessel: <b>The vessel that must maintain its course and speed unless it becomes apparent that the give-way vessel is not taking appropriate action</b>. If you must take action, do not turn toward the give-way vessel or cross in front of it.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-you-say-mayday-3-times></span>Why do you say Mayday 3 times?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Procedure calls for the mayday distress signal to be said three times in a row — Mayday! … He came up with the idea for “<b>mayday” because it sounded like the French word m’aider, which means “help me</b>.” Sometimes a mayday distress call is sent by one vessel on behalf of another vessel in danger.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-call-vhf-coast-guard></span>How do I call VHF Coast Guard?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-man-overboard-mayday-and-pan-pan></span>Is Man Overboard Mayday and Pan Pan?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A Man Overboard (MOB) situation is one of the most traumatic events on-board any vessel. Nevertheless, it is not always a MAYDAY situation. It <b>is not always a PAN PAN situation either</b>. … The choice of MAYDAY or PAN PAN for Man Overboard (MOB) situations is a judgment call made by the skipper at the time of the incident.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-do-pilots-say-when-crashing></span>What do pilots say when crashing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>THE phrase <b>“Easy Victor”</b> is one that you never want to hear your pilot say on a flight – because it means the plane is going to crash. It’s often used by pilots to warn crew to evacuate the plane without alarming passengers according to a flight attendant.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=whats-does-sos-stand-for></span>Whats does SOS stand for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Save Our Ship In Morse Code, “SOS” is a signal sequence of three dits, three dats, and another three dits spelling “S-O-S”. The expression “<b>Save Our Ship</b>” was probably coined by sailors to signal for help from a vessel in distress.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-pan-pan-call-from-an-aircraft></span>What is a Pan-Pan call from an aircraft?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The radiotelephony message PAN-PAN is <b>the international standard urgency signal</b> that someone aboard a boat, ship, aircraft, or other vehicle uses to declare that they have a situation that is urgent, but for the time being, does not pose an immediate danger to anyone’s life or to the vessel itself.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-do-pilots-say-when-landing-a-plane></span>What do pilots say when landing a plane?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>To indicate the landing clearance or final approach, the Captain will either make the following announcement and/or blink the No Smoking sign. <b>“Flight attendants, prepare for landing please.</b>” “Cabin crew, please take your seats for landing.” It may be followed by an announcement by a flight attendant.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-an-airline-pilot-say-before-takeoff></span>What does an airline pilot say before takeoff?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There is an announcement like: <b>“Flight attendants, prepare for take-off please.</b>” “Cabin crew, please take your seats for take-off.” Within a minute after take-off, an announcement might be made reminding passengers to keep their seat belts fastened.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-they-tell-you-to-put-your-head-down-on-a-plane></span>Why do they tell you to put your head down on a plane?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>This <b>prevents both flailing of the arms in the crash sequence</b> and protects the head from flying debris. The head should be as far below the top of the seats as possible to prevent injury from any collapsing overhead compartments.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-pilots-say-heavy></span>Why do pilots say heavy?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Thus, the term “heavy” (unlike light, medium and large) is included by heavy-class aircraft in radio transmissions around airports during take-off and landing, incorporated into the call sign, <b>to warn other aircraft that they should leave additional separation to avoid this wake turbulence</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-pilots-say-tree-instead-of-three></span>Why do pilots say tree instead of three?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Aviators often speak “<b>pilot English</b>” to avoid miscommunications over radio transmission. “Tree” for instance, means three, “fife” is the number five and “niner” means nine, says Tom Zecha, a manager at AOPA. The variations stemmed from a desire to avoid confusion between similar-sounding numbers, he says.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-do-pilots-say-rotate-on-takeoff></span>Why do pilots say rotate on takeoff?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Long story short, pilots say rotate as <b>a verbal queue that the aircraft has reached its predetermined Vr</b> and hence appropriate inputs can be applied to safely pitch the aircraft in a nose-up attitude to gain lift.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-was-757-discontinued></span>Why was 757 discontinued?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Amid <b>declining customer interest</b>, and despite a renewed sales campaign, the final nail in the coffin for the 757 came in 2003. At this time, Continental Airlines swapped its 757-300 orders for the smaller 737-800. This caused Boeing to announce the end of 757 production.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-fast-does-a-747-have-to-go-to-take-off></span>How fast does a 747 have to go to take off?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What speed does a Boeing 747 take off at? A fully loaded Boeing 747 ‘Jumbo Jet’ on a normal long haul flight would take off at a speed of around 160 knots which is <b>184 mph</b>. The calculated take-off speeds vary depending on environmental conditions, runway length and weight.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-v1-rotate-mean></span>What does V1 rotate mean?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>first one is the decision speed at which stopping is no longer possible and the airplane is committed to fly</b>. This is known as V1. The second speed is when the nose should be raised and the airplane is rotated into the climb attitude, known as Vr.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-the-767-still-in-production></span>Is the 767 still in production?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>767 orders and operators<p>In total, Boeing has delivered 1,215 767 aircraft (based on data from Boeing). <b>It remains in production</b>, with 93 outstanding orders for freighter (767-300F) and tanker aircraft (767-2C).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-plane-is-called-the-flying-pencil></span>What plane is called the flying pencil?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The Dornier- 17</b> – known as ‘the flying pencil’ on account of its slender shape – was a key work-horse of the Luftwaffe in the early years of World War Two. … On the morning of 26 August 1940, nine Dornier bombers took off from St Trond airfield in German occupied Belgium to bomb a key RAF fighter base – Manston in Kent.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-is-bigger-a-737-or-757></span>Which is bigger a 737 or 757?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The Boeing 737 is smaller and shorter and it has smaller, fatter, rounder engines. It has a cone shaped nose. A <b>Boeing 757 is much longer</b> and can fly long routes. It has a smaller more pointed nose and it longer slimmer engines that get smaller as they go back.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46wn7JllKSytHnCqJisrF2cwqK%2Bw2aqmrFdpbyvec%2BopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
