ATLANTA — Atlanta Police officers are pleading with the public to help them find the suspects who shot and killed people in three separate homicide cases, including the killing a 64-year-old woman. Officials are even offering a cash reward.
On Wednesday afternoon, Atlanta Police officials revealed in a press conference they'd arrested a second suspect in a shooting that left a 60-year-old man dead, lying in the walkway of a popular area on the BeltLine."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Officials are even offering a cash reward.</p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, Atlanta Police officials revealed in a press conference they'd arrested a <a href=#>second suspect</a> in a shooting that left a 60-year-old man dead, lying in the walkway of a popular area on the <a href=#>BeltLine</a>.</p><p>While police said they are aware of a third suspect's identity in this particular case, they're still searching for answers in three other cases.</p><p>"As we've looked back at the homicides that've occurred here to date, we do believe that these cases — though there are others that maintain high solvability — these cases contain a video and picture component that we believe can help move our investigation forward," Ralph Woolfolk said.</p><p>Ralph Woolfolk is with the department's homicide unit. He called on the community to speak up if they knew any information about a deadly March 1 shooting.&nbsp;</p><p>It's been weeks since <a href=#>64-year-old Lashunder Edge</a> was shot to death in a drive-by at a gas station on Lakewood Avenue infamously known as "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shoot 'em up Chevron</a>." Woolfolk said someone inside a moving car was firing gunshots while intending to shoot someone else, but the bullet fatally struck Edge.</p><p>First responders rushed her to the hospital in efforts to save her life. However, the 64-year-old woman later died. Woolfolk said the police have the vehicle and already processed it for the investigation.</p><p>"We do believe that the public has information. If you heard anything, if you observed anything on the evening of March 1, we are asking that the public come forward," he said.</p><img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/bd5dbf52-02f1-4549-a842-a1c5c6b0d9d9/bd5dbf52-02f1-4549-a842-a1c5c6b0d9d9_16x9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/bd5dbf52-02f1-4549-a842-a1c5c6b0d9d9/bd5dbf52-02f1-4549-a842-a1c5c6b0d9d9_1140x641.jpg alt onload="this.style.opacity=1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>There's another homicide case leaving investigators stumped. Among at least six shootings amid days of violence this January in the city, was a<a href=#>&nbsp;fatal incident&nbsp;</a>at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pregame Sports Bar & Grill</a> on MLK Drive in the Vine City neighborhood.</p><p>On Jan. 29, just after midnight, an argument led to an eruption of gunfire, which killed <a href=#>20-year-old Zyquan Lee</a> and sent three others to the hospital.</p><p>Pictured in surveillance video released by Atlanta Police are three people investigators believe may be connected to the case.</p><p>"Watch this video and look at their mannerisms, look at the clothing they are wearing, look at their facial expressions that you can see here -- their hair, and styles that they're wearing," Woolfolk said.&nbsp;</p><p>He asks that people "pay close attention" and provide any information to his office.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Woolfolk also said police believe a homicide that happened on Jan. 15 at 24 William H. Borders Drive has the potential to be solved, too.&nbsp;</p><p>That night, someone shot 45-year-old Mark Richards Jr. dead. Police found him lifeless on the scene.</p><p>At the Wednesday press conference, Woolfolk held up a photo of a person who was caught walking down that road that evening while sporting an orange jacket and black pants. It's who investigators believe could be a suspect in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>"He brutally, and cold-heartedly murdered an individual on this street," he said.</p><p>That person has ties to the Edgewood, Auburn Avenue area, according to Woolfolk.</p><p>"We ask that the public do what you've done so many times for the Atlanta Police Department in coming forward and providing our office with information and our detectives stand ready to collect that information," he said.</p><p>There's a $2,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in all three of these cases.&nbsp;</p><p>APD strongly urges people to contact the homicide department or Greater Atlanta Crime Stoppers with information on these cases. You can submit tips anonymously.&nbsp;</p><img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/ca1c8679-0f27-4e07-8e5a-80423f297352/ca1c8679-0f27-4e07-8e5a-80423f297352_16x9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.11alive.com/assets/WXIA/images/ca1c8679-0f27-4e07-8e5a-80423f297352/ca1c8679-0f27-4e07-8e5a-80423f297352_1140x641.jpg alt onload="this.style.opacity=1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7cn3ApaCvnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyvsdasZqWnk5a5cK3TpZinrJFivbC4yJycZqicmq6lec%2BumaWhk6h6or%2FSoqqtmZ6Ysm7Ax6ucnmWjmr2ivsCtnGagn6K2pLXDnmScmaOawHCElGZqnWiWmrF5hIycm5udXWmyoq%2BMcZhpb12WgKOFmJybbZpnlrI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
