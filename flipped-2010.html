It is threatened with being chopped down by the forces of evil, and she climbs it and won't come down. That shows some character, muses Bryce's grandfather Chet (<a href=#>John Mahoney</a>). If he were Bryce, he'd notice a girl like that. Bryce begins to catch on.</p><p>There are difficulties and the possibility of heartbreak. There always are in high school. You wear your sleeve on your heart. There are parents. Not everybody has parents like "<a href=#>Juno</a>" did. If Juno had ordinary parents, her story would be a grim morality play. But "Flipped" doesn't haul in standard parents of teenagers. Reiner wisely casts gifted actors (<a href=#>Aidan Quinn</a> and <a href=#>Penelope Ann Miller</a> as the Bakers, and <a href=#>Anthony Edwards</a> and <a href=#>Rebecca De Mornay</a> as the Loskis). He knows that Mahoney can save a wise grandfather from cornball with sheer brute force of niceness.</p><p>There's a screenplay device by Reiner and <a href=#>Andrew Scheinman</a>, based on the novel by <a href=#>Wendelin Van Draanan</a>, that could be arduous but works here because it has been thought through. The key events in the film are seen from both points of view: Bryce's and Juli's. Teenagers often lose the beat emotionally, and these two need John Philip Sousa. There isn't trickery: The scenes happen as they seem to, and not in alternate universes. But they seem so different, depending on who is seeing them.</p><p>There's one of those events so beloved by teenage girls in which they can exact excruciating embarrassment on boys while seeming to be blithely unaware. The boys are auctioned off to the girls as lunch room partners to raise money for charity. Yeah, that's what a guy wants, to stand onstage while the most patronizing teacher in the school handles the bidding. Of course, it all goes tragically wrong for Juli and Bryce, but for what seems like different reasons.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46fo6KooJqxbn6Pamc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
