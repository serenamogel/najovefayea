The goal was to inspire the readers to think like a warrior.</p><p class=dh>Cora also shared her struggles with infertility in the book. She once got into a serious car accident where the vehicle folded on her after getting hit by a truck.</p><p class=dh>A CT scan of Cora's body revealed she had cysts in both her ovaries. She was diagnosed with PCOS, a condition that causes <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/1101196/cora-jakes-coleman-overcame-infertility-through-adoption-faith/>infertility</a>.
