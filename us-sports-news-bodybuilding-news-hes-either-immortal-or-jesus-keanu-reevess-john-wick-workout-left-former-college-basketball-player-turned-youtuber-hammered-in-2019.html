With Keanu Reeves as the protagonist, the film series reached the hearts of millions through his incredible acting flair. Besides his cinematic finesse, the 58-year-old was hailed by many for his meticulous persona and aesthetic physique that he flaunted on the screen. Now, he has been making waves through his combat finesse in John Wick for over 10 years and his fandom is obviously curious about <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>the workout regimen that keeps the actor in shape</a>. Nonetheless, a Canadian fitness junkie once cracked the code of the Matrix actor’s training prompts.</span></p><p><span>Keltie O’Connor is a Canada-based social media influencer and former college basketball player. She documents vlogs about all things health and fitness. Through her YouTube handle, O’Connor keeps her fans updated with new workout drills and training sessions. Likewise, a few years ago, she pulled off the curtains from Keanu Reeves’ training regimen that helped him maintain his slender physique and deliver back-to-back megahit action sequences.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Keanu Reeves’ John Wick workout drill once left the Canadian Youtuber stupefied</strong></h2><p><span>In 2019, O’Connor shared a vlog on her YouTube channel, in which she performed the sets and reps which helped Reeves ramp up his stature with each John Wick film. While performing the core workout, O’Connor applauded the superstar and stated, “He is in his 50s and he’s still doing action movies which is mind-blowing”.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After performing the core workout session, she expressed her disbelief with the actor’s physical prowess and conceded, “the thing about Keanu Reeves is he never ages, like never. We’re all confused. He’s either immortal or Jesus”. Interestingly, O’Connor also shared several tidbits about the actor’s diet plan and praised the 58-year-old’s dietary regimen. “He eats a well-balanced diet full of nutrients, proteins, fat, carbs, and fiber, and drinks a lot of water”, added the former basketball enthusiast.</span></p><p><span>More so, the 58-year-old performed every martial arts discipline in the John Wick franchise and left his fandom to ponder over his meticulous training and ability. Nonetheless, owing to her fascination with Reeves, O’Connor also enrolled herself in Jiu-Jitsu classes. She mentioned, “Keanu Reeves did a lot of fight training, Jiu-Jitsu and all that kind of stuff”. So, what exactly is the actor’s training prompt that keeps him going stronger and better with each John Wick installment? She also mentioned that the workout was tiring and had the body exhausted and hurting after it was done despite the fact that it was not a weight heavy training schedule.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Keanu Reeves’s well-structured workout routine and training regimen</strong></h2><p><span>The training drill that gave Keanu Reeves a slender muscular physique is succinct and efficient. Unlike conventional <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>bodybuilding</a> routines, it’s designed to deliver maximum results with a modest amount of effort.

Each round of sets is followed by the rest for 2 minutes. Then, the whole process is again followed for 6 more iterations. Clearly, the 58-year-old left no stone unturned in maintaining his ripped physique and delivering blockbuster action sequences in the John Wick franchise. Now, the 4th installment of the series just got released on the proscenium curtains and it already started beating previous box-office records.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch this story:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Arnold Schwarzenegger vs Andre The Giant: Who Is Stronger?</a></p><p><span>What is your perspective on Keanu Reeves’ workout regimen?
