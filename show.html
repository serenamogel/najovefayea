They obviously wanted their buyers to go to an "authorized HP" repair shop, but as consumers are becoming more educated, using hex screws isn't something that should be embraced, in our opinion. This is why HP is also using regular screws in their notebooks like the DV1000, which is what IBM and Dell have been doing all along. This isn't to say that hex screws aren't used, but it seems that its use is diminishing.<p>As shown in the picture below, the three access panels on the bottom of the notebook can be removed to show the (top to bottom, and left to right) two SODIMM memory slots, mini-PCI slot populated by an Intel WiFi 2200BG card (802.11b/g), and the system's hard drive (Fujitsu MHT2080AT). While our system only came configured with a single memory stick (1 x 512MB Samsung M470L6524BTO DDR333), another memory module can be added to the slot left of the populated one. If you want to max it out, you will have to get 2 x 1GB memory modules.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/system/laptop/hp/DV1000/tn_system_upgrade1.jpg border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Click to enlarge.</p><br>Removing the keyboard is a bit of a trick in our opinion. In order to unsecure the keyboard from the notebook, you must first remove the battery, then unscrew the two screws that are designated with the keyboard icon. Once they are removed, you need to flip the notebook right side up and jimmy the keyboard out by sliding a flat head screw driver into one of the slots beneath the function buttons and kind of twisting it slightly towards you. This will lift the keyboard enough so that you can use your hands to remove it the rest of the way.<p>There is nothing beneath the keyboard that can be accessed by the user in the sense of upgrading or maintenance.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/system/laptop/hp/DV1000/tn_system_upgrade2.jpg border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><br>Click to enlarge.</p><br>You should be able to upgrade the CPU, since it seems that the DV1000's motherboard uses a socket CPU design. But, obviously, HP would rather have you choose the CPU that you want from the beginning and stick with it.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH51hZRobA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
