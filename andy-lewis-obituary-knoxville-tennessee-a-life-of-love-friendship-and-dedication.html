Lewis. Born on September 15, 1961, Andrew’s journey through life was marked by love, laughter, and an unwavering commitment to his family and friends. As we remember and celebrate his life, we reflect on the legacy of warmth and kindness he left behind.&nbsp;Andrew leaves behind a family who loved and cherished him dearly: his devoted wife, Lisa G. Lewis; his stepdaughter, Andrea Sliger; and his only brother, Jeffery C. In addition to his immediate family, he had a close family friend, George Gochman, who shared a special bond with Andrew.</p><p>Andrew’s journey through life was marked by his commitment to education and his dedication to his career. He graduated from the University of Tennessee with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology and Criminal Science, a testament to his passion for understanding society and his desire to make a positive impact on it.&nbsp;Professionally, Andrew was employed at Comcast, where he worked diligently alongside his colleagues. His dedication to his work was well-known, and he formed strong bonds with those he worked with. His absence in the workplace left a void that was felt not only professionally but also on a personal level by his colleagues.</p><p>As we remember Andrew, we are reminded of his warmth, kindness, and unwavering commitment to his loved ones. He possessed a genuine and caring spirit that drew people to him. His infectious laughter and welcoming smile brightened the lives of those who had the privilege of knowing him.&nbsp;Andrew’s bond with his family was a source of immeasurable joy and strength. He shared a deep and abiding love with his wife, Lisa, and stepdaughter, Andrea. Their journey together was marked by love, support, and the creation of lasting memories. Andrew’s role as a husband and stepfather was a reflection of his deep commitment to family, and his love will forever resonate in the hearts of those he held dear.</p><p>Andrew’s brother, Jeffery C., shared a unique and unbreakable bond with him. Their relationship was characterized by shared experiences, shared laughter, and an unspoken understanding that only siblings can truly appreciate. Andrew’s memory will forever live on in the heart of his brother.&nbsp;George Gochman, a close family friend, held a special place in Andrew’s life. Their friendship was a testament to the enduring power of camaraderie and shared experiences. George played a significant role in Andrew’s life, and their connection was a source of joy and support.&nbsp;Andrew’s wishes were to be cremated and laid to rest at sea alongside the rest of his family. This final resting place reflects his connection to the sea and the desire to be reunited with his loved ones who had gone before him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJmemcZuuMSwoKxln5e2tcHAq7Bmo56kxbe1y6WcZqyVo7umv9KenGaZXaG2p7GMqJ1mpJ%2Brsm6y0aKcp5yjnbaxecCnm2aclZm2pK3ToqanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
