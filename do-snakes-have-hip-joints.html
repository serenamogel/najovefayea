Some of the more primitive species like boas and python do have vestigial remnants of the pelvic girdle and femur.

There is no snake in which the limb remnants still retain a function in locomotion, but complete or reduced elements of the pelvis and femur remain in many snake families, including the boa and python families. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on britannica.com</a><h2>Why do snakes not have hip bones?</h2>Answer and Explanation: No, snakes do not have hip bones.

They have a special skull (more on this later!) and they have a very long spine, made up of hundreds of vertebrae (the bones that make up our backbone). They also have hundreds of ribs, almost the whole way down their body, to protect their organs. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on biomedicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au</a><h2>Why snakes do not possess legs?</h2>“They don't need them,” Morin said. “From the way they move, to the places they can go and some of the methods of subduing prey, like constriction, having legs would simply get in the way.

Wrong--look closely! Pythons and boa constrictors have tiny hind leg bones buried in muscles toward their tail ends. Such features, either useless or poorly suited to performing specific tasks, are described as vestigial. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on amnh.org</a><h2>Do snakes have a brain?</h2>Snakes represent a special case among reptiles because the braincase almost entirely encloses the whole brain, which in turn practically fills the neurocranial cavity.

Alternatively, push your free hand under its tail to loosen it. If this doesn't work, tickle your snake, spray its mouth with rubbing alcohol or vinegar, or hold its head underwater. When a snake constricts on your arm, your first thought is to tug at it to loosen its grip. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Why did snakes lose their arms?</h2>By losing their limbs, snakes gained a more streamlined body shape, which allowed them to move more efficiently through narrow spaces and burrow into the ground. This adaptation also reduced their weight, making them more agile and better suited for hunting and evading predators. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>What did snakes evolve from?</h2>Both fossils and phylogenetic studies demonstrate that snakes evolved from lizards, hence the question became which genetic changes led to limb loss in the snake ancestor. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on en.wikipedia.org</a><h2>What snakes have pelvic bones?</h2>Pelvic spurs are the externally visible portion of the vestigial remnants of legs found on each side of the vent in primitive snakes, such as boas and pythons. The remnants of a pelvis and femur, which have no connection with the spine, simply 'float' in the muscle mass. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on ebi.ac.uk</a><h2>Do snakes have a breastbone?</h2>Snakes do not have thoracic limbs, a sternum or pectoral girdle but a pelvic girdle may be present.
