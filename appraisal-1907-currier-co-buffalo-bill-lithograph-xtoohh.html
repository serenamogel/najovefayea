It was given to my great-grandfather.
He immigrated from Italy to Pueblo, Colorado, and they lived on the mesa, and then went by wagon train to Greenhorn.
They had bought some property there.
It had a well that was the only water between Pueblo and Walsenburg on the old highway.
It was said that when the stagecoach was running, Buffalo Bill came through, he took a liking to my grandfather, and gave him this picture, and they hung it in the restaurant that was there."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Hm?</p><p>GUEST: Yeah, very subdued, yeah.</p><p>APPRAISER: Almost funereal, right?</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p>APPRAISER: So I thought, "Oh, maybe this is a posthumous print."</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: But then you look at it and it says "Yours, cordially," you know, "Colonel W.F.</p><p>Cody (Buffalo Bill)."</p><p>So it's while he's still alive.</p><p>And then I looked cl, more closely, and it's really faint, but in the lower right hand corner, you can see that it was printed by the Currier Litho Company in Buffalo, New York, and it's dated 1907.</p><p>GUEST: Okay.</p><p>APPRAISER: So this is a 1907 lithograph.</p><p>And, and Bill, although... You know, he died in 1917.</p><p>By 1907, his career was not as large as it had been a, a few years prior to that.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: But he was still performing.</p><p>What do you think this is worth?</p><p>GUEST: I tried to get it appraised once, and it wa, they said it was anywhere from $200 to, it could be more.</p><p>APPRAISER: That's a very general appraisal.</p><p>GUEST: Yeah.</p><p>(chuckles) APPRAISER: (laughs) GUEST: It was.</p><p>But we just, I love it, and, uh, it's been a part of the family forever.</p><p>APPRAISER: I think that if this were to come to auction without the printer's mark on it...</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p>APPRAISER: ...people wouldn't have the actual historical context, the date in which it came from.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: And I think having the Currier Lithograph mark on it and the date 1907 really helps add that extra level of, of context, authenticity, and value.</p><p>If this was Bill on his horse...</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p>APPRAISER: ...if this was Bill in a fictitious recreation of some famous battle that he did...</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: ...it might have some extra appeal.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: Buffalo Bill really is one of the, still one of the top marquee names in collectibles.</p><p>GUEST: Mm-hmm.</p><p>APPRAISER: At auction, I would estimate it between $4,000 and $6,000.</p><p>GUEST: Okay.</p><p>Well, thank you.</p><p>It's going to still have a, its favorite place at my house.</p><p>(laughs) APPRAISER: And it's one of those things, because it's so rare, it wouldn't surprise me if it went even higher.</p><p>GUEST: Uh-huh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2BrtqWxzmiYqaiilra0rctmaHJoZ2Kwtr7RopyrZZOkeqPBxZ%2BYpaddl7atuIyloK2gn5y%2ForzHZq%2Btp5%2BdtXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
