She revealed she "totally gutted" her master bedroom among her many <a href=#>home improvement projects</a>. Additionally, Tamra told the outlet she installed new flooring, new window treatments and fresh paint throughout the house.</p><p data-children-count=0>One of her favorite features in the home includes her over-the-top bathroom. "We have the very fancy toilet that washes you front and back and dries you and the seat is warm," she told the publication. "And when you walk in, it cleans itself and it lights up. So that's pretty fancy." The happy couple also helped themselves to a "big stand-up bathtub" to compliment Tamra's "<a href=#>gigantic walk-in closet</a>."</p><p data-children-count=0>As for any recreational activities around the home, Tamra said she bought a pool table "because the kids were bored" and is considering adding a jacuzzi to the property. "It's very hot here so it'd be very nice to just go <a href=#>[wind down] by the pool</a>," she shared.</p><p data-children-count=0>Now that Tamra is pleased with the inside of her abode, "next is going to be the exterior," she revealed. To "spruce it up a little bit," they plan to add a fresh coat of paint and enhance their landscaping. Sounds like this OG knows how to live!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma25laX11e9ahnKudXZm8pr%2BMrZimqpFit7awxp5kpaGmmnqiusNmn6ivXZe2qHnIrGShnaJitbDB0p5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
