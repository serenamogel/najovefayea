The heartbroken and bitter Davy Jones abandoned his duty and returned to the seven seas. As a result, the Flying Dutchman itself became cursed, just as Jones was.<h2>Did they remove the Kraken from the Sea of Thieves?</h2>Sea of Thieves' Kraken has been disabled to make way for the Cursed Sails update.
