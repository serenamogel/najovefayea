The Warriors will face defending champion Waimea in the state championship next Saturday. The Maui News / MATTHEW THAYER photos</p><p>PUKALANI — The numbers from Saturday night show just how dominating the Kamehameha Schools Maui football team was in its 31-10 win over Pac-5 at Kanaiaupuni Stadium.</p><p>The victory sends the Warriors to their second First Hawaiian Bank/HHSAA Division II state championship game in the last three seasons — there is a feeling of unfinished business that has lingered on the Pukalani campus since that 61-7 loss to Kapaa in late 2021.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It feels amazing, you know, that loss our sophomore year for our seniors, like, it really drove us the past two years,”</span> Kamehameha Maui senior quarterback Makana Kamaka-Brayce said after he threw for 256 yards and three touchdowns in his final game in Pukalani. <span class=quotations>“We didn’t have the best year last year, but this feels good ending on this note.”</span></p><p>In getting back to the state title game, the Warriors simply rolled past the Wolfpack. KSM will face Waimea, the No. 1 seed and defending champion, at 4 p.m. Saturday at Mililani High School on Oahu.</p><p>Among the eye-popping dominance of the statistics were these numbers: Kamehameha Maui had 24 first downs to eight for Pac-5; the Warriors outgained the Wolfpack 432 yards to 161; and the time of possession favored KSM 33 minutes, 18 seconds to 14:42.</p><img width=861 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/11/20071933/fc-mt-fb-ksm-kaikea-hueu-861x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Kamehameha Maui’s Kaikea Hueu takes a second-quarter reception into the end zone Saturday night.</p><p>The Warriors had the ball for 9:11 of the 12-minute fourth quarter as they ran out the clock.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We’re fortunate to be heading back to the finals, you know, this is a different team than the one that we had (in 2021), different circumstances,”</span> Kamehameha Maui head coach Ulima Afoa said. “I really feel good about the kids that we have. Our coaches have done a great job all year and so I’m just ecstatic for our kids, I’m ecstatic for our school, I’m ecstatic for our coaches.</p><p><span class=quotations>“This is just proof that if you stick by the things that you preach — pursuing standards and keeping the process in play, you know, taking one thing at a time — some times it works out pretty good.”</span></p><p>After taking a 7-0 lead on Kaonohi Casco’s 3-yard run midway through the first quarter, Kamaka-Brayce found Shane Ueki with a 9-yard touchdown pass to make it 14-3 with 10:34 left in the first half, capping an eight-play, 71-yard drive.</p><p>Kamehameha Maui dropped the hammer on Pac-5 in the final minute of the first half.</p><img width=1075 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/11/20071940/fc-mt-fb-ksm-kaonohi-casco-1075x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>The Warriors’ Ka‘onohi Casco returns the opening kickoff for a big gain.</p><p>Freshman running back Kaikea Hueu caught an 8-yard scoring pass to finish off a six-play, 66-yard drive that made it 21-3 with 53 seconds left in the second quarter.</p><p>Then most of the doubt in the outcome was wiped out when Ramzak Fruean smacked Elijah Connell-Chavez, forcing a fumble that Ramzen Fruean recovered on the Pac-5 24-yard line.</p><p>Three plays later, following a sack, Kamaka-Brayce found Dylan Schnitzer for a 34-yard score to extend the lead to 28-3 with 14 seconds left before halftime.</p><p>Schnitzer led the Warriors receiving corps with six catches for 78 yards and the backbreaking touchdown reception. The team was missing University of Hawaii verbal commit Frank Abreu, who sat out with a slight knee injury.</p><p>Abreu was dressed for the game, but did not play. He gave a thumbs-up when asked from a distance if he would play in the state championship game.</p><img width=1045 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/11/20071919/fc-mt-fb-ksm-defense-ronin-souza-1045x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Kamehameha Maui’s Ronin Souza tackles Pac-5’s Elijah Connell-Chavez in the first quarter.</p><p><span class=quotations>“That’s going to be huge, you know, having him out there in the rotation, it helps a lot in spreading the defense out,”</span> Kamaka-Brayce said of Abreu. <span class=quotations>“They key on him a lot, so that’ll help.”</span></p><p>Hueu led the way on the ground with 90 yards on 15 carries, and sophomore Zedekiah Campbell added 72 yards on seven carries. The pair of close friends are known as <span class=quotations>“Thunder and Lightning”</span> on this team.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I’m Lightning because lightning is quick, he’s Thunder because he brings the boom,”</span> Campbell said with a wide smile.</p><p>Leading the young rushers, the offensive line has no seniors and just one junior among its starters.</p><p><span class=quotations>“All love to my linemen, bro, they’re amazing,”</span> Campbell said. <span class=quotations>“Dude, the whole season they’ve been going all out, blocking to the best of their ability, probably one of the best in the (Maui Interscholastic League).”</span></p><img width=596 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/11/20071952/fc-mt-fb-ksm-shane-ueki-596x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>The Warriors’ Shane Ueki hauls in a touchdown pass in the second quarter.</p><p>Hueu added that the versatility for the KSM rushing attack has been a key to the team’s success all season.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It feels good, all of us, we get an equal amount of playing time, equal amount of rest,”</span> Hueu said. <span class=quotations>“Since the first game we played together it’s been so much fun. It’s great, it’s just great.”</span></p><p>Pac-5 coach Kena Heffernan led his team to its first-ever HHSAA tournament win last week, 32-7 over Kaimuki. The Wolfpack coach was impressed with the Warriors.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Oh my goodness, hats off to Kamehameha — I will tell you right now, first of all the Kamehameha fans here, fantastic sportsmanship, all love out here, they made us feel welcome as well as we were getting challenged,”</span> Heffernan said. <span class=quotations>“Much love to the fans, their kids are very tough kids, they’re well-coached, they’ve got a great group over here. You know, a lot of love for Maui right now.”</span></p><p>* Robert Collias is at rcollias@mauinews.com.</p><img width=889 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2023/11/20071946/fc-mt-fb-ksm-makana-kamaka-brayce-889x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Kamehameha Maui quarterback Makana Kamaka-Brayce throws a first-quarter pass.</p><p>Pac-530 0 7–10</p><p>KS Maui 7 21 30–31</p><p>First Quarter</p><p>KSM–Kaonohi Casco 3 run (Kaden Yap kick), 6:08.</p><p>P5–FG Evan Derauf 34, 2:16.</p><p>Second Quarter</p><p>KSM–Shane Ueki 9 pass from Makana Kamaka-Brayce (Yap kick), 10:34.</p><p>KSM–Kaikea Hueu 8 pass from Kamaka-Brayce (Yap kick), 0:53.</p><p>KSM–Dylan Schnitzer 34 pass from Kamaka-Brayce (Yap kick), 0:14.</p><p>Third Quarter</p><p>KSM–FG Yap 20, 8:49.</p><p>Fourth Quarter</p><p>P5–Elijah Connell-Chavez 61 run (Derauf kick), 11:48.</p><p>P5 KSM</p><p>First downs 8 24</p><p>Rushes-yards 17-10935-175</p><p>Passing yards 52 257</p><p>Total offense 161 432</p><p>Return yards 23 92</p><p>Comp-Att-Int 6-21-118-34-1</p><p>Fumbles-lost 1-11-1</p><p>Penalties-yards6-44 13-114</p><p>Punts-avg7-28.6 2-33.0</p><p>INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS</p><p>RUSHING–Pac-5, Connell-Chavez 10-110, Sean Fujimoto 1-1, Seth Miller 6-(minus 2); Kamehameha Maui, Hueu 15-90, Zedekiah Campbell 7-72, Kamaka-Brayce 7-20, Dane Nakagawa 1-4, Casco 1-3, Kolten Waikiki-Caldeira 1-(minus 2), team 3-(minus 12).</p><p>PASSING–Pac-5, Colten Amai-Nakagawa 6-21-1-52; Kamehameha Maui, Kamaka-Brayce 17-33-1-256, Waikiki-Caldeira 1-1-0-1.</p><p>RECEIVING–Pac-5, Miller 2-29, Jerome Lilio 1-12, Mission Uperesa-Thomas 1-7, Colt Hauptman 1-4, Don Kalenate 1-0; Kamehameha Maui, Schnitzer 6-78, Ueki 4-19, Keegan Gantala 3-58, Teiva Kauhaa-Po 1-65, Campbell 1-14, Tevyn Apo 1-14, Hueu 1-8, Piikoa Kamoku 1-1.</p><p>MISSED FIELD GOALS–KSM, Yap 30 (SH).</p><p>*****</p><p>FOOTBALL STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS</p><p>DIVISION II</p><p>Saturday’s Results • Semifinals</p><p>No. 2 Kamehameha Maui 31, No. 3 Pac-5 10</p><p>No. 1 Waimea 13, No. 4 Roosevelt 10</p><p>Saturday, Nov. 25 • Championship</p><p>Kamehameha Maui vs. Waimea at Mililani, 4 p.m.</p><p>DIVISION I</p><p>Saturday’s Results • Semifinals</p><p>No. 1 Konawaena 37, No. 5 Kapaa 19</p><p>No. 2 Waipahu 21, Farrington 20</p><p>Saturday, Nov. 25 • Championship</p><p>Konawaena vs. Waipahu at Mililani, 7 p.m.</p><p>OPEN DIVISION</p><p>Friday’s Results • Semifinals</p><p>No. 1 Mililani 44, Campbell 7</p><p>Kahuku 28, No. 2 Punahou 16</p><p>Friday, Nov. 24 • Championship</p><p>Mililani vs. Kahuku at Clarence T.C.
