The good news is, Øvredal’s stylishly old-school flick doesn’t require any homework—your affection for genre-work like “<a href=#>The Changeling</a>,” “Ringu” and “The Night of the Living Dead” as well as a mild nostalgic appreciation for “Goonies”-type fare will suffice. Though it’s still helpful to know that these are anthology-style books. Co-scribes Dan and Kevin Hagemen (along with story crafters del Toro, <a href=#>Marcus Dunstan</a> and <a href=#>Patrick Melton</a>) have created a unifying (though choppy) narrative arc around a number of the popular yarns of the books—“Harold,” “The Big Toe” and “The Red Spot” among them—while keeping with the novels’ PG-13 spirit. Among the things “Scary Stories” might wake up could very well be a newfound appetite for horror in younger movie-watchers.</p><p>At the heart of the tale that celebrates the healing power of storytelling is the sweetly introverted Stella (Zoe Margaret Colletti of “<a href=#>Wildlife</a>”), a motherless aspiring writer with dad issues and a love of all-things-scary—her room is decorated wall-to-wall with tales and creatures she worships. There is also the enigmatic Ramón (<a href=#>Michael Garza</a>), a Mexican-American teen who attempts to pass through town, but lingers around after saving Stella’s crew from bullies one night at the drive-in. Then we have the nerdy Auggie (<a href=#>Gabriel Rush</a>) in a Pierrot costume for Halloween—his outfit choice is a successful running gag—the goofy Chuck (<a href=#>Austin Zajur</a>) as well as his beautiful, popular sister Ruth (<a href=#>Natalie Ganzhorn</a>). When the quintet visits an out-of-bounds, boarded-up mansion with a tragic past one night and takes away a storybook belonging to the spirit of the once-murderous Sarah Bellows (Kathleen Pollard)—she is said to be locked away by her rich and cruel family—they disturb the vengeful ghost and end up disappearing one by one. Gruesome tales start to slowly appear in the book, designed in accordance with the teens’ worst fears.</p><p>Predictably, the set pieces of Øvredal’s film are a lot more fun to enjoy individually than to consider them within the context of the overarching tale. In that, the seams around the anthology show—we don’t quite connect with the kids’ individual fears in a deep sense when their nightmares find them. Thankfully however, even Øvredal seems to know the parts here are greater than the sum and doesn’t shy away from showing off the visual tricks he’s got up his sleeve to make each spine-tingling sequence pop in their own way. From the astonishing opening montage featuring Donovan's “<a href=#>Season of the Witch</a>” (a new version by Lana Del Rey comes in the end)&nbsp;to crawling spiders and stalker-y ghouls, the bite-sized thrills of “Scary Stories” pack plenty of jolts, though more effective for adolescent eyeballs than adults.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46smpqqqWLAtbvRopysZaSkerWxy6VkoqZdqbWmecOaqaRlYmV%2Beg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
