The beginning opens with Maria, calling police to her home as she claims she killed three people during her exorcism in the 1980's. From here we are witnessing the police's crime scene investigation video. Which was neither incredible nor pain stakingly boring."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Yet, towards the second and third it will have fallen apart with a disappointing end."</p><p>The beginning opens with Maria, calling police to her home as she claims she killed three people during her exorcism in the 1980's. From here we are witnessing the police's crime scene investigation video. Which was neither incredible nor pain stakingly boring. The police descend into the basement where all the action took place. Blood is all over the floor, a wooden chair where Maria was strapped in is broken at the arms. But where is Maria? The investigators look, no not that corner or that one. Then a growl and Maria appears suddenly. Fade out Maria is arrested, then sentenced to life in Centrino Mental Hospital in Rome.</p><p>Unfortunately, Maria left behind her daughter, Isabella. Cut 20 years later to Isabella who wants to know what happened to her mother. So she makes a documentary. This destroyed the film by being documentary style. Really? No crane shots, no dollies, no cherry pickers, no wild inserts, no interesting close ups? Just bullshit hand held documentary style that becomes painfully boring to watch as it limits your variety of angles.</p><p>So, yes Isabella goes to Rome to try to save her mother. During their first encounter became boring. The dialogue was insanely cliche and random screaming from the demon only goes so far. It scratches the surface of what demonic horror could be.</p><p>Maria's second and final exorcism should have been a crescendo of film technique (camera/lighting/sound/acting/editing/actor blocking/etc) into this powerful moment and turning point. As a visionary one has to understand that all the above elements have to sing in harmony all throughout a film, but especially during an exorcism scene because everything is at stake in those moments. You have to push the limits in layers of technique.</p><p>The exorcism scene was horrible... I felt incredibly disconnected to the moment nor did I care about the characters journeys. I was irritated because it could have been so rich with waves of intensity.. Finally crashing to the shore letting the audience go, gasping for air.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq6eXmr9uscGeqa1npJ2yunnWmqWtnZRiwamxyKtkpqeemsZursCcomaZlqmys3nToZxmnJWrtq15yKeqopyV</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
