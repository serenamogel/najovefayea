Most of these theories have to do with an abundance of characters — both old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and new</a> — in the franchise’s sixth installment. And while a handful of these figures have been studied and recognized in prior movies in the series, one specific character has raised suspicions amongst the fandom due to their pure mystery and ominous presence in the upcoming feature.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=376 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>The aforementioned character in question would be <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Czerny</a></strong>’s mysterious and seemingly unidentifiable character, who fans have pointed out in a recent Reddit thread on the r/scream sub-platform. In the thought-provoking post, one user mentioned the lack of Czerny in the trailer or on the movie’s official poster — which certainly sparks a certain degree of mistrust.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=676 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Why is Henry Czerny not in the trailer or poster? Does he have a small role in Scream 6?</a> from <a href=#>Scream</a></figure><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Unsurprisingly, fellow Scream fanatics were quick to flood the comment section — with many of them convinced that Czerny’s caracter is the “mastermind” behind this movie’s version of Ghostface. In that same vein, however, Czerny has simultaneously been outed as Sam’s therapist — which at least provides some information in regards to his involvement.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>OceansideGuy93’s comment from discussion "Why is Henry Czerny not in the trailer or poster?

Nevertheless, when Scream fans have a suspect in mind, it’s almost guaranteed that their opinions won’t budge in the slightest.</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=83 data-injectable=false>Find out who the killer truly is when Scream VI slashers into theaters on March 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGalqajBpr7IqKysZZ6axG6%2FwqucmqVdq7Zur8eaqZqbpJq%2FbrTArGSapKKarqXFjKuYoquVmXq0wdKpoJyhn6PAbq3MqKWgq6RiwamxjJ%2BYp5yfonw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
