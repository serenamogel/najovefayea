In fact, <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> reported that "Dangerous" experienced a 1,220% increase in digital album sales and a 327% uptick in song sales. Wallen's reaction to the hugely popular album was mixed, because he acknowledged that his racist controversy might have had something to do with the record sales, per the <a href=#>New York Post</a>.</p><p>Either way, such media exposure would likely have been too much for the star back when he was on "The Voice." In a 2019 interview with <a href=#>People</a>, Wallen explained that he was thankful for getting kicked off the show when he did, because he wouldn't have been ready to enter the country music industry had he won. "I'm thankful for how it all turned out," he told the outlet. "And honestly, I'm thankful that I didn't win because it gave me a chance to take a couple years after the show and really figure out who I was as an artist and get the right team around me. When I got there, I had no clue what I was doing."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW9kaX5ze9ahsGaln6e0orqMsJilpJWjerit0maepZmUYrWmecOim6esXay2r3nToZxmrp%2BesKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
