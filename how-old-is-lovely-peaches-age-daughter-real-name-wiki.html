Peaches is perhaps best known for her former TikTok account which was followed by over 100,000 people, but which was deleted because she repeatedly violated TikTok’s terms of usage. It appears that Peaches <a rel=nofollow href=#>wasn’t much liked by her ‘fans’</a>, as they often call her ‘an evil person’ on the internet, and have claimed that every video she had uploaded onto her account featured the same music.</p><p>As of October 2020, Peaches’ age is 19.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_education>Early life and education</span></h2><p>Peaches was raised an only child by her mother who is a cleaning lady, and as she hasn’t talked about her father, it’s believed by many that her parents haven’t lived together for some day.</p><p>Peaches was bullied at school for her looks and her weight, so she found comfort on the internet – she launched her Instagram account at a very early age, and began uploading pictures taken during her everyday life. Peaches enrolled at a high school in 2015, but the bullying continued there which is why she became shy and began avoiding people.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>She matriculated in 2019</a> and has decided not to pursue a college degree, but to focus on her career on the internet – there are many people who believe that Peaches hasn’t matriculated from high school, and that she dropped out at the age of 16.</p><h2><span id=Career_as_a_social_media_celebrity>Career as a social media celebrity</span></h2><p>Peaches was very active on Instagram but her account has been removed for unknown reasons -she may have deleted it, but given some of the content that she uploads, management may have made the decision; there’s currently only a fan page of Peaches on site, which is followed by over 2,600 people.</p><p>She has a Facebook page which is liked by around 300 people, while her Twitter account is currently followed by nearly 3,000 people.</p><p>Peaches has also tried to become a popular YouTuber, as she launched her channel on 31 August 2013, while all her 45 videos were uploaded in 2017 and 2018. There are over 440 people subscribed to the channel and her most popular video “CupcakKe – Spoiled Milk Titties (Audio)” has been watched over 120,000 times since 6 January 2018. In most of her videos, <a rel=nofollow href=#>Peaches talks about seducing men</a> and infecting them with sexually transmitted diseases!</p><p>Peaches is also active on Patreon, and offers three subscription options to her patrons, the exact number of whom and how much money she receives per month isn’t known.</p><h2><span id=Husband_and_daughter>Husband and daughter</span></h2><p>Peaches has been keeping the details of her love life hidden from the media’s attention, but it’s known that she became pregnant at the age of 16 and decided not to have an abortion but to give birth to her daughter – hence the possibility that she dropped out of school.</p><p>Peaches hasn’t talked about the father of the girl, but it is believed that he is someone from her high school, who later refused to have anything to do with their daughter.</p><p>Peaches named her daughter Cory, and she was mostly raised by her &nbsp;parents. In March 2019, Cory, then aged 19 months, and her grandmother Catherine Hagelstein were hit by a jeep at an intersection in Carolina Beach and <a rel=nofollow href=#>Cory died on the spot</a>, while Catherine ended up with a broken left foot and today has to walk with the help of a cane. People remember Cory as an energetic child who loved to play with dogs, and who enjoyed meeting people.</p><p>There are still people who believe that Cory who died in the car accident wasn’t Peaches’ daughter, and that Peaches’ Cory is still alive and well. Cory has on many occasions written about hurting her daughter and selling her to people, which is why police contacted and visited her several times.</p><p>Peaches hasn’t talked about any men she might have been with, and as of October 2020, she is single, hasn’t married and doesn’t have children.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.org///marriedbiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/EDGK4PmXkAAFvhu-693x1024.jpg></p><h2><span id=Hobbies_and_other_interests>Hobbies and other interests</span></h2><p>Peaches used to spend most of her free time on the internet, creating her videos, uploading pictures, and chatting with her ‘fans’, but she is no longer that active, and it’s believed that she’s working as a cashier at a supermarket.</p><p>She is a lover of animals, with dogs being her favorites, she but has a pet cat as it’s easier to maintain than a dog. Peaches prefers being at home, and can rarely be seen taking a walk or doing anything outdoors.</p><p>She is keen on watching movies and TV series, and her favorite actor and actress are Jim Carrey and Angelina Jolie, while a couple of her favorite movies are “Bruce Almighty”, “Liar Liar” and “Mr. and Mrs Smith”. <a rel=nofollow href=#>Her favorite TV series is “Charmed”</a>.</p><h2><span id=Height_and_net_worth>Height and net worth</span></h2><p>Peaches has long brown hair and brown eyes, her height is 5ft 5ins (1.65m) and she weighs around 242lbs (110kgs).</p><p>As of October 2020, her net worth has been estimated at just over $100,000.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDm6Con6KWvanFjaipoGeYpMRuu8udZKKrXaG8t7HLsmSpnZGYtaa%2FjJqenmWUlsKotNOeqWaqlZa5brrAppxmr5mgtnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
