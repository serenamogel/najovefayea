For me, every day always looks a little different. Some days are spent shooting photos, other days are spent writing blog posts, planning recipes, laying out book pages, emailing, testing, the list goes on and on. Suffice it to say, many of my days are pretty chaotic, so one thing I’ve learned to value over time is having a morning routine.

We loved it all – although my sister and I could honestly care less about the food because the morning was all about waking up and waiting sooooo patiently for my parents to get their coffee before we could start opening presents. The recipe suggestions here are a little more homemade, but hey no judgement if you have…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfqa6oe8GrnJqjlpbAtXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
